"def choose_num(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the\n    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If \n    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> choose_num(12, 15)\n    14\n    >>> choose_num(13, 12)\n    -1\n    \"\"\"\n    if x < y:\n        return choose_num(y, x)\n    else:\n        return choose_num(x, y)\n"
