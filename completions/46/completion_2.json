"def triangle_area(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of\n    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. \n    Otherwise return -1\n    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater \n    than the third side.\n    Example:\n    >>> triangle_area(3, 4, 5)\n    6.0\n    >>> triangle_area(1, 2, 10)\n    -1\n    \"\"\"\n    if a + b > c:\n        return (a + b) * c / 2\n    else:\n        return -1"
