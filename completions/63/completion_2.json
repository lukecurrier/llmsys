"def fib4(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:\n    fib4(0) -> 0\n    fib4(1) -> 0\n    fib4(2) -> 2\n    fib4(3) -> 0\n    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).\n    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.\n    >>> fib4(5)\n    4\n    >>> fib4(6)\n    8\n    >>> fib4(7)\n    14\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)\n"
