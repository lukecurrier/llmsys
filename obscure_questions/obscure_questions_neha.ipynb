      "{'id': '6849', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy%20Young', 'title': 'Cy Young', 'text': 'Denton True \"Cy\" Young (March 29, 1867 – November 4, 1955) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. Born in Gilmore, Ohio, he worked on his family\\'s farm as a youth before starting his professional baseball career. Young entered the major leagues in 1890 with the National League\\'s Cleveland Spiders and pitched for them until 1898. He was then transferred to the St. Louis Cardinals franchise. In 1901, Young jumped to the American League and played for the Boston Red Sox franchise until 1908, helping them win the 1903 World Series. He finished his career with the Cleveland Naps and Boston Rustlers, retiring in 1911.\\n\\nYoung was one of the hardest-throwing pitchers in the game early in his career. After his speed diminished, he relied more on his control and remained effective into his forties. By the time Young retired, he had established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for over a century. He holds MLB records for the most career wins, with 511, along with most career losses, innings pitched, games started, and complete games. He led his league in wins during five seasons and pitched three no-hitters, including a perfect game in 1904.\\n\\nYoung was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. In 1956, one year after his death, the Cy Young Award was created to honor the best pitcher in each league for each season.\\n\\nEarly life\\nCy Young was the oldest child born to Nancy (Mottmiller) and McKinzie Young, Jr., and was christened Denton True Young. He was of part German descent. The couple had four more children: Jesse Carlton, Alonzo, Ella, and Anthony. When the couple married, McKinzie\\'s father gave him the  of farm land he owned. Young was born in Gilmore, a tiny farming community located in Washington Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio.  \\n\\nHe was raised on one of the local farms and went by the name Dent Young in his early years. Young was also known as \"Farmer Young\" and \"Farmboy Young\". Young stopped his formal education after he completed the sixth grade so he could help out on the family\\'s farm. In 1885, Young moved with his father to Nebraska, and in the summer of 1887, they returned to Gilmore.\\n\\nYoung played for many amateur baseball leagues during his youth, including a semi-professional Carrollton team in 1888. Young pitched and played second base. The first box score known containing the name Young came from that season. In that game, Young played first base and had three hits in three at-bats. After the season, Young received an offer to play for the minor league Canton team, which started Young\\'s professional career.\\n\\nProfessional baseball career\\n\\nMinor leagues\\nYoung began his professional career in 1889 with the Canton, Ohio, team of the Tri-State League, a professional minor league. During his tryout, Young impressed the scouts, recalling years later, \"I almost tore the boards off the grandstand with my fast ball.\" Cy Young\\'s nickname came from the fences that he had destroyed using his fastball. The fences looked like a cyclone had hit them. Reporters later shortened the name to \"Cy\", which became the nickname Young used for the rest of his life. During Young\\'s one year with the Canton team, he won 15 games and lost 15.\\n\\nFranchises in the National League, the major professional baseball league at the time, wanted the best players available to them. Therefore, in 1890, Young signed with the Cleveland Spiders, a team which had moved from the American Association to the National League the previous year.\\n\\nCleveland Spiders\\nOn August 6, 1890, Young\\'s major league debut, he pitched a three-hit 8–1 victory over the Chicago Colts. While Young was on the Spiders, Chief Zimmer was his catcher more often than any other player. Bill James, a baseball statistician, estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other battery in baseball history.\\n\\nEarly on, Young established himself as one of the harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young\\'s fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On the last day of the season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young\\'s career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young\\'s ability. Anson told Spiders manager Gus Schmelz, \"He\\'s too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He\\'s not worth it now, but I\\'m willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him.\" Schmelz replied, \"Cap, you can keep your thousand and we\\'ll keep the rube.\"\\n\\nTwo years after Young\\'s debut, the National League moved the pitcher\\'s position back by . Since 1881, pitchers had pitched within a \"box\" whose front line was  from home base, and since 1887 they had been compelled to toe the back line of the box when delivering the ball. The back line was  away from home. In 1893,  was added to the back line, yielding the modern pitching distance of . In the book The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers, sports journalist Rob Neyer wrote that the speed with which pitchers like Cy Young, Amos Rusie, and Jouett Meekin threw was the impetus that caused the move.\\n\\nThe 1892 regular season was a success for Young, who led the National League in wins (36), ERA (1.93), and shutouts (9). Just as many contemporary Minor League Baseball leagues operate today, the National League was using a split season format during the 1892 season. The Boston Beaneaters won the first-half title, and the Spiders won the second-half title, with a best-of-nine series determining the league champion. Despite the Spiders\\' second half run, the Beaneaters swept the series, five games to none. Young pitched three complete games in the series, but lost two decisions. He also threw a complete game shutout, but the game ended in a scoreless tie.\\n\\nThe Spiders faced the Baltimore Orioles in the Temple Cup, a precursor to the World Series, in 1895. Young won three games in the series and Cleveland won the Cup, four games to one. It was around this time that Young added what he called a \"slow ball\" to his pitching repertoire to reduce stress on his arm. The pitch today is called a changeup.\\n\\nIn 1896, Young lost a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single. On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders committed four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said that, despite his teammate\\'s gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.\\n\\nShift to St. Louis\\nPrior to the 1899 season, Frank Robison, the Spiders owner, bought the St. Louis Browns, thus owning two clubs simultaneously. The Browns were renamed the \"Perfectos\", and restocked with Cleveland talent. Just weeks before the season opener, most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis, including three future Hall of Famers: Young, Jesse Burkett, and Bobby Wallace. The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team, as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and 1900. Meanwhile, the depleted Spiders lost 134 games, the most in MLB history, before folding. Young spent two years with St. Louis, which is where he found his favorite catcher, Lou Criger. The two men were teammates for a decade.\\n\\nMove to Boston of the American League\\n\\nIn 1901, the rival American League declared major league status and set about raiding National League rosters. Young left St. Louis and joined the American League\\'s Boston Americans for a $3,500 contract ($ today). Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909. In his first year in the American League, Young was dominant. Pitching to Criger, who had also jumped to Boston, Young led the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA, thus earning the colloquial AL Triple Crown for pitchers. Young won almost 42% of his team\\'s games in 1901, accounting for 33 of his team\\'s 79 wins. In February 1902, before the start of the baseball season, Young served as a pitching coach at Harvard University. The sixth-grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers. The following year, Young coached at Mercer University during the spring. The team went on to win the Georgia state championship in 1903, 1904, and 1905.\\n\\nThe Boston Americans played the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first modern World Series in 1903. Young, who started Game One against the visiting Pirates, thus threw the first pitch in modern World Series history. The Pirates scored four runs in that first inning, and Young lost the game. Young performed better in subsequent games, winning his next two starts. He also drove in three runs in Game Five. Young finished the series with a 2–1 record and a 1.85 ERA in four appearances, and Boston defeated Pittsburgh, five games to three games.\\n\\nAfter one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to face him so that he could repeat his performance against Boston\\'s ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, \"How do you like that, you hayseed?\"\\n\\nWaddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young\\'s perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after he allowed a hit, Young\\'s scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher\\'s box was only  from home base (the modern release point is about  farther away); walks required eight balls; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young\\'s perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 4–2, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: \"For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in.\" In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.\\n\\nIn 1908, Young pitched the third no-hitter of his career. Three months past his 41st birthday, Cy Young was the oldest pitcher to record a no-hitter, a record which would stand 82 years until 43-year-old Nolan Ryan surpassed the feat. Only a walk kept Young from his second perfect game. After that runner was caught stealing, no other batter reached base. At this time, Young was the second-oldest player in either league. In another game one month before his no-hitter, he allowed just one single while facing 28 batters. On August 13, 1908, the league celebrated \"Cy Young Day\". No American League games were played on that day, and a group of All-Stars from the league\\'s other teams gathered in Boston to play against Young and the Red Sox. When the season ended, he posted a 1.26 ERA, which gave him not only the lowest in his career, but also a major league record of being the oldest pitcher with 150+ innings pitched to post a season ERA under 1.50.\\n\\nCleveland Naps and retirement\\nYoung was traded back to Cleveland, the place where he played over half his career, before the 1909 season, to the Cleveland Naps of the American League. The following season, 1910, he won his 500th career game on July 19 against Washington. He split 1911, his final year, between the Naps and the Boston Rustlers. On September 22, 1911, Young shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates, 1–0, for his last career victory. In his final start two weeks later, the last eight batters of Young\\'s career combined to hit a triple, four singles, and three doubles. By the time of his retirement, Young\\'s control had faltered. He had also gained weight. In two of his last three years, he was the oldest player in the league.\\n\\nCareer accomplishments\\nYoung established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for over a century. Young compiled 511 wins, which is the most in major league history and 94 ahead of Walter Johnson, second on the list. At the time of Young\\'s retirement, Pud Galvin had the second most career wins with 364. In addition to wins, Young still holds the major league records for most career innings pitched (7,356), most career games started (815), and most complete games (749). He also retired with 316 losses, the most in MLB history. Young\\'s career record for strikeouts was broken by Johnson in 1921. Young\\'s 76 career shutouts are fourth all-time.\\n\\nYoung led his league in wins five times (1892, 1895, and 1901–1903), finishing second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He won at least 30 games in a season five times. He had 15 seasons with 20 or more wins, two more than the runners-up, Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. Young won two ERA titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young\\'s earned run average was below 2.00 six times, but this was not uncommon during the dead-ball era. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times. Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings fourteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the WHIP ratio was not calculated until well after Young\\'s death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times. Young is tied with Roger Clemens for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher. They each won 192 games while with the franchise. In addition, Young pitched three no-hitters, including the third perfect game in baseball history, first in baseball\\'s \"modern era\".\\n\\nYoung also was an above average hitting pitcher in his career. He posted a .210 batting average (623-for-2960) with 325 runs, 18 home runs, 290 RBI and drew 81 bases on balls. From 1891 through 1905, he drove in 10 or more runs for 15 straight seasons, with a high of 28 RBI in 1896.\\n\\nPitching style\\nParticularly after his fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. He was once quoted as saying, \"Some may have thought it was essential to know how to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control.\" In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury, owing partly to his ability to pitch in different arm positions (overhand, three-quarters, sidearm and even submarine). For 19 consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his league\\'s top 10 for innings pitched; in 14 of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games. By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. \"I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it,\" said Young, \"and there wasn\\'t any use wasting them.\" He once described his approach before a game:\\nI never warmed up ten, fifteen minutes before a game like most pitchers do. I\\'d loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I\\'d relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I\\'d take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That\\'s why I was able to work every other day.\\n\\nManagerial record\\n\\n* Stepped down to a player only role.\\n\\nLater life\\n\\nIn 1910, it was reported that Young was a vegetarian. Beginning in 1912, Young lived and worked on his farm. In 1913, he served as manager of the Cleveland Green Sox of the Federal League, which was at the time an outlaw league. However, he never worked in baseball after that.\\n\\nIn 1916, he ran for county treasurer in Tuscarawas County, Ohio. \\n\\nYoung\\'s wife, Roba, whom he had known since childhood, died in 1933. After she died, Young tried several jobs, and eventually moved in with friends John and Ruth Benedum and did odd jobs for them. Young took part in many baseball events after his retirement. In 1937, 26 years after he retired from baseball, Young was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was among the first to donate mementos to the Hall.\\n\\nBy 1940, Young\\'s only source of income was stock dividends of $300 per year ($ today). On November 4, 1955, Young died on the Benedums\\' farm at the age of 88. He was buried in Peoli, Ohio.\\n\\nLegacy\\n\\nYoung\\'s career is seen as a bridge from baseball\\'s earliest days to its modern era; he pitched against stars such as Cap Anson, already an established player when the National League was first formed in 1876, as well as against Eddie Collins, who played until 1930. When Young\\'s career began, pitchers delivered the baseball underhand and fouls were not counted as strikes. The pitcher\\'s mound was not moved back to its present position of  until Young\\'s fourth season; he did not wear a glove until his sixth season.\\n\\nYoung was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. In 1956, about one year after Young\\'s death, the Cy Young Award was created to honor the best pitcher in Major League Baseball for each season. The first award was given to Brooklyn\\'s Don Newcombe. Originally, it was a single award covering all of baseball. The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967, one for each league.\\n\\nOn September 23, 1993, a statue dedicated to him was unveiled by Northeastern University on the site of the Red Sox\\'s original stadium, the Huntington Avenue Grounds. It was there that Young had pitched the first game of the 1903 World Series, as well as the first perfect game in the modern era of baseball. A home plate-shaped plaque next to the statue reads:\\nOn October 1, 1903 the first modern World Series between the American League champion Boston Pilgrims (later known as the Red Sox) and the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates was played on this site. General admission tickets were fifty cents. The Pilgrims, led by twenty-eight game winner Cy Young, trailed the series three games to one but then swept four consecutive victories to win the championship five games to three.\\n\\nIn 1999, 88 years after his final major league appearance and 44 years after his death, editors at The Sporting News ranked Young 14th on their list of \"Baseball\\'s 100 Greatest Players\". That same year, baseball fans named him to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n 300 win club\\n List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders\\n List of Major League Baseball career ERA leaders\\n List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders\\n List of Major League Baseball career shutout leaders\\n List of Major League Baseball career hit batsmen leaders\\n Triple Crown (baseball)\\n List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders\\n List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders\\n List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders\\n List of Major League Baseball annual shutout leaders\\n List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders\\n Major League Baseball titles leaders\\n List of Major League Baseball no-hitters\\n List of Major League Baseball individual streaks\\n List of Major League Baseball player-managers\\n List of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers\\n Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame\\n\\nNotes\\n a. Although the phrase \"perfect game\" appeared in record books as early as 1922, and was a common expression years before that, Major League Baseball did not formalize the definition of a \"perfect game\" until 1991, long after Young\\'s death. Nonetheless, Young\\'s 1955 obituary also used the phrase.\\n\"An official perfect game occurs when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings. In a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.\"\\n b.Although it is not an actual award, many baseball fans and experts call a pitcher who leads his league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA the Triple Crown winner.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nJane Benedum Oral History Interview on Cy Young (1 of 2) - National Baseball Hall of Fame Digital Collection\\nJane Benedum Oral History Interview on Cy Young (2 of 2) - National Baseball Hall of Fame Digital Collection\\n\\n1867 births\\n1955 deaths\\n19th-century baseball players\\nNational Baseball Hall of Fame inductees\\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\\nMajor League Baseball player-managers\\nBoston Americans players\\nBoston Red Sox managers\\nBoston Red Sox players\\nBoston Rustlers players\\nCleveland Naps players\\nCleveland Spiders players\\nSt. Louis Perfectos players\\nMajor League Baseball pitchers who have pitched a perfect game\\nAmerican League Pitching Triple Crown winners\\nAmerican League ERA champions\\nAmerican League strikeout champions\\nAmerican League wins champions\\nNational League ERA champions\\nNational League strikeout champions\\nNational League wins champions\\nMinor league baseball managers\\nCanton Nadjys players\\nCanton Statesmen players\\nHarvard Crimson baseball coaches\\nBaseball players from Ohio\\nPeople from Harrison County, Ohio\\nPeople from Tuscarawas County, Ohio\\nCleveland Green Sox players'}\n",

      "{'id': '355345', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Tell%20%28opera%29', 'title': 'William Tell (opera)', 'text': 'William Tell (; ) is a French-language opera in four acts by Italian composer Gioachino Rossini to a libretto by Victor-Joseph Étienne de Jouy and L. F. Bis, based on Friedrich Schiller\\'s play Wilhelm Tell, which, in turn, drew on the William Tell legend. The opera was Rossini\\'s last, although he lived for nearly 40 more years. Fabio Luisi said that Rossini planned for Guillaume Tell to be his last opera even as he composed it. The often-performed overture in four sections features a depiction of a storm and a vivacious finale, the \"March of the Swiss Soldiers\".\\n\\nParis Opéra archivist Charles Malherbe discovered the original orchestral score of the opera at a secondhand book seller\\'s shop, resulting in its being acquired by the Paris Conservatoire.\\n\\nPerformance history\\n\\nGuillaume Tell was first performed by the Paris Opéra at the Salle Le Peletier on 3 August 1829, but within three performances cuts were being made and after a year only three acts were performed. The opera\\'s length, roughly four hours of music, and casting requirements, such as the high range required for the tenor part, have contributed to the difficulty of producing the work. When performed, the opera is often cut. Performances have been given in both French and Italian. Political concerns have also contributed to the varying fortunes of the work.\\n\\nIn Italy, because the work glorified a revolutionary figure against authority, the opera encountered difficulties with the Italian censors, and the number of productions in Italy was limited. The Teatro San Carlo produced the opera in 1833, but then did not give another production for around 50 years. The first Venice production, at the Teatro La Fenice, was not until 1856. By contrast, in Vienna, in spite of censorship problems there, the Vienna Court Opera gave 422 performances over the years 1830 to 1907. As Hofer, or the Tell of the Tyrol, the opera was first performed at Drury Lane in London on 1 May 1830 (in English), with a production in Italian following in 1839 at Her Majesty\\'s, and in French at Covent Garden in 1845. In New York, William Tell was first presented on 19 September 1831. It was revived at the Metropolitan Opera in 1923 with Rosa Ponselle and Giovanni Martinelli, and there were revivals during the 1930s in Milan, Rome, Paris, Berlin and Florence. When the opera was performed at Gran Teatre del Liceu (Barcelona) in 1893, an anarchist threw two Orsini bombs in the theatre.\\n\\nIn the later 20th century there were major productions in Florence (1972), Geneva (1979, 1991), La Scala (1988), Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1989), Covent Garden (1990), and then Opéra Bastille (2003) as well as at the Sportspalace in Pesaro (lasting over 5 hours, 1995).\\nIn 2010 there was an important revival of the opera, when it opened the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia\\'s season, under Antonio Pappano. This performance was of the French version, with some cuts to particularly the fourth act (which Pappano noted had been approved by Rossini himself). A live recording of this concert performance was released in 2011, and the production was transferred to The Proms in July of that year, with Michele Pertusi taking on the title role, Patricia Bardon as Hedwige, Nicolas Courjal as Gessler, and Mark Stone as Leuthold. The performance was very well reviewed, and marked the first full performance of the work in the history of the Proms.\\n\\nA co-production by the Dutch National Opera and the Metropolitan Opera New York of the opera in the original French opened at the Met in October 2016 with Gerald Finley in the title role.\\n\\nAccording to an anecdote, when an admirer told the composer that he had heard his opera the previous night, Rossini replied \"What? The whole of it?\". Another version of the story refers only to act 2. In 1864 Offenbach quoted the patriotic trio from act 2, \"Lorsque la Grèce est un champ de carnage\" in La belle Hélène.\\n\\nOverture\\n\\nThe famous overture to the opera is often heard independently of the complete work. Its high-energy finale, \"March of the Swiss Soldiers\", is particularly familiar through its use in the American radio and television shows of The Lone Ranger. Several portions of the overture were used prominently in the films A Clockwork Orange and The Eagle Shooting Heroes; in addition, Dmitri Shostakovich quotes the main theme of the finale in the first movement of his 15th symphony. The overture has four parts, each linked to the next:\\n\\n\"The Prelude (Dawn)\" is written only for the cello section (including parts for five soloists), the double basses, and the timpani, in a slow tempo and in E major.\\n\"The Storm\" is a dynamic section played by the full orchestra, with backup from the trombones, in E minor.\\nThe \"Ranz des Vaches\", or \"call to the dairy cows\", features the cor anglais (English horn) and the flute. It is in G major.\\nThe finale (\"March of the Swiss Soldiers\") is an ultra-dynamic \"cavalry charge\" galop heralded by horns and trumpets, and is played by the full orchestra in E major.\\n\\nRoles\\n\\nInstrumentation\\nThe instrumentation is:\\nWoodwinds: a piccolo, a flute, 2 oboes (1st doubles cor anglais), 2 clarinets in A and 2 bassoons\\nBrass: 4 horns (2 in G and 2 in E), 4 trumpets in E and 3 trombones\\nPercussion: 2 timpani, triangle, bass drum, cymbals, bell and tam-tam\\nStrings: first violins, second violins, viola, violoncelli, double basses, 2 harps\\nOn stage: 4 horns\\n\\nSynopsis\\nPlace: Austrian-occupied Switzerland\\nTime: 13th century\\n\\nAct 1\\n\\nBy the shore of Lake Lucerne, at Bürglen in the canton of Uri\\n\\nIt is the day of the Shepherd Festival, in May, near Lake Lucerne. The action opens on an idyllic scene, with the local peasants busily preparing chalets for three newly wedded couples, singing as they work (Quel jour serein le ciel présage – \"What a serene day the sky foretells\"). The fisherman, Ruodi, sings a gentle love song from his boat (to orchestral accompaniment from the harps and flutes). Tell stands apart from the general merriment, however: he is consumed with ennui at Switzerland\\'s continued oppression (Il chante, et l\\'Helvétie pleure sa liberté – \"He sings, and Helvetia mourns her liberty\"). His wife and son add their own interpretation of Ruodi\\'s song, presaging the coming nautical dramas.\\n\\nThe activities are interrupted by the ranz des vaches resounding from the hills (often performed by off-stage horns, and echoing in its theme the ranz de vaches in the opera\\'s overture).  The horns also signal the arrival of Melchthal, a respected elder of the canton.  He is persuaded by Hedwige to bless the couples at the celebration.  However, his son Arnold, though of marriageable age, is not participating and is evidently uncomfortable.  The entire on-stage cast sings in celebration (Célebrons tous en ce beau jour, le travail, l\\'hymen et l\\'amour – \"Let all celebrate, on this glorious day, work, marriage and love\").  Tell invites Melchthal into his chalet; before they move off, Melchthal chides his son for his failure to marry.\\n\\nHis father\\'s rebuke provokes an outpouring of despair from Arnold: in his recitative we learn of his previous service in the forces of the Austrian rulers, his rescue of Mathilde from an avalanche, and the conflict between his love for her and his shame at serving the \"perfidious power\".  Horn fanfares herald the approach of Gesler, the Austrian governor, whom the Swiss detest, and his entourage.  Arnold moves off to greet their arrival, as Mathilde will accompany them, but is stopped by Tell.  Inquiring as to where Arnold is going, Tell persuades him to consider joining the planned rebellion against the governor. The expressive duet in which this takes place again shows the tension Arnold feels between his love for Mathilde and the \"fatherland\" (Ah! Mathilde, idole de mon âme!...Ô ma patrie, mon cœur te sacrifie... – \"Ah, Mathilde, idol of my soul...O my fatherland, my heart sacrifices to you...\").  By the end of the exchange, Arnold is prepared to confront Gesler the moment he arrives; Tell persuades him to at least let the festival pass in peace, but knows he has gained a convert to the cause of freedom.\\n\\nThe villagers then reassemble, and Melchthal blesses the couples.  The blessing is followed by singing, dancing and an archery contest that Tell\\'s young son Jemmy wins with his first shot – a result of his \"paternal heritage\".  It is Jemmy who notices the hurried approach of the pale, trembling and wounded shepherd, Leuthold, who killed one of Gesler\\'s soldiers to defend his daughter and is fleeing the governor\\'s forces.  He seeks to escape to the opposite shore, but the cowardly Ruodi refuses to take him in his boat, fearing that the current and the rocks make approaching the opposite bank impossible.  Tell returns from searching for the departed Arnold just in time: even as the soldiers approach, calling for Leuthold\\'s blood, Tell takes Leuthold into the boat and out onto the water.  Gesler\\'s guards arrive, led by Rodolphe, who is further incensed by the villagers\\' prayers and their evident joy at the escape.  Melchthal urges the villagers not to tell Rodolphe who it was who aided Leuthold, and is taken prisoner by the guards.  As Rodolphe and the soldiers promise retribution (Que du ravage, que du pillage sur ce rivage pèse l\\'horreur!), Tell\\'s family and friends take comfort in Tell\\'s skills as an archer, which will surely save them.\\n\\nAct 2\\nOn the heights of Rütli, overlooking the Lake and the Cantons\\n\\nA hunting party of ladies and gentlemen, accompanied by soldiers, hears the sound of the shepherds returning from the hills as night approaches.  Hearing the Governor\\'s horns, they too take their leave.  Mathilde, however, lingers, believing she has glimpsed Arnold in the vicinity.  She is, like Arnold, anguished by the love she feels for her rescuer, and contemplates it as she sings (Sombre forêt, désert triste et sauvage – \"Somber forest, sad and savage wilderness\").  Arnold appears, and each confesses to the other their desire for this meeting.  In their duet (Oui, vous l\\'arrachez à mon âme – \"Yes, you wring from my soul\"), they recognise their mutual passion, but also the obstacles they face.  Urging him to \"return to the fields of glory\", Mathilde assures him of the eventual acceptability of his suit, and leaves at the approach of Tell and Walter.  They question Arnold as to why he loves Mathilde, a member of the oppressing Austrians.  Arnold, offended by their spying, declares his intention to continue fighting for the Austrians, and thus gain glory, rather than liberty.  However, when Walter tells him that Gesler has executed his father Melchthal, Arnold vows revenge (Qu\\'entends-je? ô crime! – \"What do I hear? O crime!\").\\n\\nAs the three men affirm their dedication – \"to independence or death\" – they hear the sound of someone else approaching.  It is the men of the canton of Unterwalden coming to join the fight, and describing their journey in a rather gentle refrain (Nous avons su braver).  In quick succession, they are joined by the men of Schwyz (En ces temps de malheurs) and Uri (Guillaume, tu le vois).  The gathering is complete, and the tone and tempo of the finale rises as the men of the three cantons affirm their willingness to fight or die for the freedom of Switzerland (Jurons, jurons par nos dangers – \"Let us swear, let us swear by our dangers\").  Plans are made to arm the cantons and to rise up when \"the beacons of vengeance burn\".\\n\\nAct 3\\n\\nScene 1: A ruined/deserted chapel in the Altdorf palace grounds\\n\\nArnold has come to tell Mathilde that, instead of leaving for battle, he is staying to avenge his father, and thereby renouncing both glory and Mathilde. When he tells her that it was Gesler who had his father executed, she denounces his crime, and recognises the impossibility of their love (Pour notre amour, plus d\\'espérance – \"All hope for our love has gone\"). Hearing preparations for the coming festival in the palace grounds, they bid a fond farewell to each other (Sur la rive étrangère – \"Though upon a foreign shore\").\\n\\nScene 2: The main square at Altdorf\\n\\nThe day is the hundredth anniversary of Austrian rule in Switzerland.  Soldiers sing of the glories of Gesler and the Emperor.  In commemoration, Gesler has had his hat placed on top of a pole and the Swiss are ordered and then forced to pay homage to the hat.  Gesler commands that there should be dancing and singing to mark the century during which the empire has \"deigned to sustain [Swiss] weakness\", and a variety of dances and choruses follow.  Soldiers have noticed Tell and his son in the crowd, refusing to pay homage to the hat, and drag him forward.  Rodolphe recognises him as the man who assisted in Leuthold\\'s escape, and Gesler orders his arrest.  In a complex choir and quartet, the soldiers express their hesitation at arresting this famed archer (C\\'est là cet archer redoutable – \"It\\'s that redoubtable archer\"), Gesler forces them to act, and Tell urges Jemmy to flee, but he prefers to stay with his father.\\n\\nGesler notices the affection Tell has for his son, and has Jemmy seized.  Inspired, he devises his test: Tell must shoot an arrow through an apple balanced on Jemmy\\'s head – should he refuse, both of them will die.  The assembled Swiss are horrified at this cruelty, but Jemmy urges his father to courage, and refuses to be tied up for the challenge.  Resigned, Tell retrieves his bow from the soldiers, but takes two arrows from his quiver and hides one of them.  He sings an anguished aria to Jemmy, instructing him (Sois immobile – \"Stay completely still\"), and the two separate.  Finally, Tell draws his bow, shoots, and drives the arrow through the apple and into the stake.  The people acclaim his victory, and Gesler is enraged.  Noticing the second arrow, he demands to know what Tell intended for it.  Tell confesses his desire to kill Gesler with the second arrow, and both he and Jemmy are seized for execution.\\n\\nMathilde enters and claims Jemmy in the name of the emperor, refusing to let a child die (Vous ne l\\'obtiendrez pas – \"You will not have him\"). Gesler announces his intention to take Tell across Lake Lucerne to the fort at Kusnac/Küssnacht, and there to throw him to the reptiles in the lake. Rodolphe expresses concern at attempting a journey on the lake in the storm, but Gesler intends to force Tell, an expert boatman, to pilot the vessel. They leave, amid conflicting cries of \"Anathema on Gesler\" from the people, and \"Long live Gesler\" from the soldiers.\\n\\nAct 4\\nScene 1: Old Melchthal\\'s house\\n\\nArnold, aware of Tell\\'s arrest, is dispirited, but, set on revenge, draws strength from being in his father\\'s former home and sings a moving lament (Ne m\\'abandonne point, espoir de la vengeance... Asile héréditaire... – \"Do not abandon me, hope of vengeance... Home of my forefathers\"). Would-be \"confederates\" arrive, sharing and reinforcing his hope of vengeance. Revived, Arnold points them to the weapons cache that his father and Tell had prepared. Seeing the men armed, Arnold launches into the hugely demanding (Amis, amis, secondez ma vengeance – \"Friends, friends, assist my vengeance\"), replete with multiple and sustained top Cs. Resolved, they leave to storm Altdorf and free Tell.\\n\\nScene 2: The rocky shore of Lake Lucerne\\n\\nHedwige is wandering by the lake, distraught. She tells the other women she intends to beg Gesler for Tell\\'s life. In the distance, she hears Jemmy calling. Her son enters, along with Mathilde, whom Hedwige entreats for assistance. In some versions, Mathilde, Jemmy and Hedwige sing a moving trio (Je rends a votre amour un fils digne de vous – \"I return to your love a son worthy of you\"). Jemmy tells his mother that Tell is no longer in Altdorf, but on the lake, at which point Hedwige begins precipitously to mourn (Sauve Guillaume! Il meurt victime de son amour pour son pays – \"Save William! He dies a victim of his love for his country\"). Leuthold arrives, telling the assembled villagers that the boat carrying Tell, Gesler and the soldiers is being driven towards the rocks by a storm that has broken over the lake – Leuthold believes that the chains have been removed from Tell\\'s hands, so that he might pilot the boat to safety.\\n\\nThe boat pulls into view, and Tell jumps ashore before pushing the boat back. He is amazed to see his house burning in the distance. Jemmy tells him that, for want of a beacon, he set fire to their home but, before doing so, he retrieved his father\\'s bow and arrows. Gesler and the soldiers come into view, intent on recapturing Tell, who kills Gesler with a single shot and the cry, \"Let Switzerland breathe!\" Walter and a group of confederates arrive, having seen the burning house. Tell informs them of Gesler\\'s death, but cautions that Altdorf still stands. Arnold and his band enter, and break the happy news: they have taken Altdorf. Arnold sees Mathilde, who declares herself \"disabused of false grandeur\" and ready to join the fight for liberty at his side.\\n\\nThe clouds break, and the sun shines on a pastoral scene of wild beauty. The gathered Swiss fighters and women sing a paean to the magnificence of nature and the return of freedom in a lyrical C major (Tout change et grandit en ces lieux... Liberté, redescends des cieux – \"Everything is changing and growing grander in this place... Liberty, descend again from heaven\") as the ranz des vaches motif returns once again and finally.\\n\\nNoted excerpts\\nOverture\\n\"Ah, Mathilde, je t\\'aime et je t\\'adore\" (Arnold, act 1)\\n\"Sombre forêt\" (Mathilde, act 2)\\n\"Oui, vous l\\'arrachez à mon âme\" (Mathilde, Arnold, act 2)\\n\"Quand l\\'Helvétie est un champs de supplice... Ses jours qu\\'ils ont osé proscire... Embrasons-nous d\\'un saint délire\" (Tell, Arnold, Walter, act 2)\\n\"Pour notre amour... Sur la rive étrangère\" (Mathilde, act 3)\\n\"Sois immobile\" (Tell, act 3)\\n\"Asile héréditaire... Amis, amis, secondez ma vengeance\" (Arnold, act 4)\\n\\nDuring the Crimean War John MacLeod transcribed \"La tua danza sì leggiera\", a chorus part in the third act, to create the tune \"The Green Hills of Tyrol\", a well-known retreat march in the Scottish bagpipe tradition. The musician Andy Stewart added lyrics and the song in 1961 became a hit under the name \"A Scottish Soldier\".\\n\\nRecordings\\n\\nIn popular culture \\nCharacters and scenes from the opera William Tell are recognisable on the court cards and aces of William Tell cards, playing cards that were designed in Hungary around 1835. These cards spread across the Austro-Hungarian Empire and are still the most common German-suited playing cards in that part of the world today. Characters portrayed on the Obers and Unters include: Hermann Gessler, Walter Fürst, Rudolf Harras and William Tell.\\n\\nReferences\\nNotes\\n\\nSources\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n  in \\n \\n \\n \\n  in\\n\\nFurther reading\\n Osborne, Richard (1990), Rossini, Ithaca, New York: Northeastern University Press. \\n Osborne, Richard (1996), \"Guillaume Tell\", vol. 2, pp.\\xa0573–576, in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, edited by Stanley Sadie.

      "Top documents for question: In what year did Car Talk officially end its radio distribution?\n",
      "Similarity: 0.7930\n",
      "{'id': '6960', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car%20Talk', 'title': 'Car Talk', 'text': 'Car Talk is a  radio talk show that was broadcast weekly on National Public Radio (NPR) stations and elsewhere. Its subjects were automobiles and automotive repair, often discussed humorously. It was hosted by brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi, known also as Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers. The show won a Peabody Award in 1992.\\n\\nThe show ran from 1977 until October 2012, when the Magliozzi brothers retired. Edited reruns (introduced as The Best of Car Talk) continued to be available for weekly airing on NPR\\'s national schedule up through September 30, 2017, and some NPR affiliates have continued to broadcast reruns. Past episodes are otherwise available in a podcast format.\\n\\nOn June 11, 2021, it was announced that radio distribution of Car Talk would officially end on October 1, 2021, and that NPR would begin distribution of a twice-weekly podcast that will be 35-40 minutes in length and include early versions of every show, in sequential order.\\n\\nPremise\\nCar Talk was presented in the form of a call-in radio show: listeners called in with questions related to motor vehicle maintenance and repair. Most of the advice sought was diagnostic, with callers describing symptoms and demonstrating sounds of an ailing vehicle while the Magliozzis made an attempt to identify the malfunction over the telephone and give advice on how to fix it. While the hosts peppered their call-in sessions with jokes directed at both the caller and at themselves, the Magliozzis were usually able to arrive at a diagnosis. However, when they were stumped, they attempted anyway with an answer they claimed was \"unencumbered by the thought process\", the official motto of the show.\\n\\nEdited reruns are carried on XM Satellite Radio via both the Public Radio and NPR Now channels.\\n\\nThe Car Talk theme music was \"Dawggy Mountain Breakdown\" by bluegrass artist David Grisman.\\n\\nCall-in procedure\\nThroughout the program, listeners were encouraged to dial the toll-free telephone number, 1-888-CAR-TALK (1-888-227-8255), which connected to a 24-hour answering service. Although the approximately 2,000 queries received each week were screened by the Car Talk staff, the questions were unknown to the Magliozzis in advance as \"that would entail researching the right answer, which is what? ...\\xa0Work.\"\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nThe show originally consisted of two segments with a break in between but was changed to three segments. After the shift to the three-segment format, it became a running joke to refer to the last segment as \"the third half\" of the program.\\n\\nThe show opened with a short comedy segment, typically jokes sent in by listeners, followed by eight call-in sessions. The hosts ran a contest called the \"Puzzler\", in which a riddle, sometimes car-related, was presented. The answer to the previous week\\'s \"Puzzler\" was given at the beginning of the \"second half\" of the show, and a new \"Puzzler\" was given at the start of the \"third half\". The hosts gave instructions to listeners to write answers addressed to \"Puzzler Tower\" on some non-existent or expensive object, such as a \"$26 bill\" or an advanced digital SLR camera. This gag initially started as suggestions that the answers be written \"on the back of a $20 bill\". A running gag concerned Tom\\'s inability to remember the previous week\\'s \"Puzzler\" without heavy prompting from Ray. During a tribute show following Tom\\'s death in 2014 due to complications of Alzheimer\\'s Disease, Ray joked, \"I guess he wasn\\'t joking about not being able to remember the puzzler all those years.\" For each puzzler, one correct answer was chosen at random, with the winner receiving a $26 gift certificate to the Car Talk store, referred to as the \"Shameless Commerce Division\".  It was originally $25, but was increased for inflation after a few years. Originally, the winner received a specific item from the store, but it soon changed to a gift certificate to allow the winner to choose the item they wanted (though Tom often made an item suggestion).\\n\\nA recurring feature was \"Stump the Chumps,\" in which the hosts revisited a caller from a previous show to determine the accuracy and the effect, if any, of their advice. A similar feature began in May 2001, \"Where Are They Now, Tommy?\"  It began with a comical musical theme with a sputtering, backfiring car engine and a horn as a backdrop.  Tom then announced who the previous caller was, followed by a short replay of the essence of the previous call, preceded and followed by harp music often used in other audiovisual media to indicate recalling and returning from a dream.  The hosts then greeted the previous caller, confirmed that they had not spoken since their previous appearance and asked them if there had been any influences on the answer they were about to relate, such as arcane bribes by the NPR staff.  The repair story was then discussed, followed by a fanfare and applause if the Tappet Brothers\\' diagnosis was correct, or a wah-wah-wah music piece mixed with a car starter operated by a weak battery (an engine which wouldn\\'t start) if the diagnosis was wrong.  The hosts then thanked the caller for their return appearance.\\n\\nThe brothers also had an official Animal-Vehicle Biologist and Wildlife Guru named Kieran Lindsey. She answered questions like How do I remove a snake from my car? and offered advice on how those living in cities and suburbs could reconnect with wildlife. They also would sometimes rely on Harvard University professors Wolfgang Rueckner and Jim E. Davis for questions concerning physics and chemistry, respectively.\\n\\n There were numerous appearances from NPR personalities, including Bob Edwards, Susan Stamberg, Scott Simon, Ray Suarez, Will Shortz, Sylvia Poggioli, and commentator and author Daniel Pinkwater. On one occasion, the show featured Martha Stewart as an in-studio guest, whom the Magliozzis twice during the segment referred to as \"Margaret\". Celebrities and public figures were featured as \"callers\" as well, including Geena Davis, Ashley Judd, Morley Safer, Gordon Elliott, former Major League Baseball pitcher Bill Lee, and astronaut John M. Grunsfeld.\\n\\nSpace program calls\\nAstronaut and engineer John Grunsfeld called into the show during Space Shuttle mission STS-81 in January 1997, in which Atlantis docked to the Mir space station. In this call he complained about the performance of his serial-numbered, Rockwell-manufactured \"government van\". To wit, it would run very loud and rough for about two minutes, quieter and smoother for another six and a half, and then the engine would stop with a jolt. He went on to state that the brakes of the vehicle, when applied, would glow red-hot, and that the vehicle\\'s odometer displayed \"about 60 million miles\". This created some consternation for the hosts, until they noticed the audio of Grunsfeld\\'s voice, being relayed from Mir via TDRS satellite, sounded similar to that of Tom Hanks in the then-recent film Apollo 13, after which they realized the call was from space and the government van in question was, in fact, the Space Shuttle.\\n\\nIn addition to the on-orbit call, the Brothers once received a call asking advice on winterizing an electric car. When they asked what kind of car, the caller stated it was a \"kit car\", a $400 million \"kit car\". It was a joke call from NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory concerning the preparation of the Mars Opportunity rover for the oncoming Martian winter, during which temperatures drop to several hundred degrees below freezing. Click and Clack have also been featured in editorial cartoons, including one where a befuddled NASA engineer called them to ask how to fix the Space Shuttle.\\n\\nHumor\\n\\nHumor and wisecracking pervaded the program. Tom and Ray are known for their self-deprecating humor, often joking about the supposedly poor quality of their advice and the show in general. They also commented at the end of each show: \"Well, it\\'s happened again—you\\'ve wasted another perfectly good hour listening to Car Talk.\"\\n\\nAt some point in almost every show, usually when giving the address for the Puzzler answers or fan mail, Ray mentioned Cambridge, Massachusetts (where the show originated), at which point Tom reverently interjected with a tone of civic pride, \"Our fair city\". Ray invariably mocked \"\\'Cambridge, MA\\', the United States Postal Service\\'s two-letter abbreviation for \\'Massachusetts\"\\', by pronouncing the \"MA\" as a word.\\n\\nPreceding each break in the show, one of the hosts led up to the network identification with a humorous take on a disgusted reaction of some usually famous person to hearing that identification.  The full line went along the pattern of, for example, \"And even though Roger Clemens stabs his radio with a syringe whenever he hears us say it, this is NPR: National Public Radio\" (later just \"...\\xa0this is NPR\").\\n\\nAt one point in the show, often after the break, Ray usually stated that: \"Support for this show is provided by,\" followed by an absurd fundraiser.\\n\\nThe ending credits of the show started with thanks to the colorfully nicknamed actual staffers: producer Doug \"the subway fugitive, not a slave to fashion, bongo boy frogman\" Berman; \"John \\'Bugsy\\' Lawlor, just back from the\\xa0...\" every week a different eating event with rhyming foodstuff names; David \"Calves of Belleville\" Greene; Catherine \"Frau Blücher\" Fenollosa, whose name caused a horse to neigh and gallop (an allusion to a running gag in the movie Young Frankenstein); and Carly \"High Voltage\" Nix, among others.  Following the real staff was a lengthy list of pun-filled fictional staffers and sponsors such as statistician Marge Innovera (\"margin of error\"), customer care representative Haywood Jabuzoff (\"Hey, would ya buzz off\"), meteorologist Claudio Vernight (\"cloudy overnight\"), optometric firm C.\\xa0F. Eye Care (\"see if I care\"), Russian chauffeur Picov Andropov (\"pick up and drop off\"), Leo Tolstoy biographer Warren Peace (\"War and Peace\"), hygiene officer and chief of the Tokyo office Oteka Shawa (\"oh, take a shower\"), Swedish snowboard instructor Soren Derkeister (\"sore in the keister\"), law firm Dewey, Cheetham & Howe (\"Do we cheat \\'em? And how!\"), Greek tailor Euripides Eumenades (\"You rip-a these, you mend-a these\"), cloakroom attendant Mahatma Coate (\"My hat, my coat\"), seat cushion tester Mike Easter (my keister) and many, many others, usually concluding with Erasmus B. Dragon (\"Her ass must be draggin\\'\"), whose job title varied, but who was often said to be head of the show\\'s working mothers\\' support group.  They sometimes advised that \"our chief counsel from the law firm of Dewey, Cheetham, & Howe is Hugh Louis Dewey, known to a group of people in Harvard Square as Huey Louie Dewey.\"  Huey, Louie, and Dewey were the juvenile nephews being raised by Donald Duck in Walt Disney\\'s Comics and Stories. Guest accommodations were provided by The Horseshoe Road Inn (\"the horse you rode in\").\\n\\nAt the end of the show, Ray warns the audience, \"Don\\'t drive like my brother!\" to which Tom replies, \"And don\\'t drive like my brother!\"  The original tag line was \"Don\\'t drive like a knucklehead!\"  There were variations such as, \"Don\\'t drive like my brother\\xa0...\" \"And don\\'t drive like his brother!\" and \"Don\\'t drive like my sister\\xa0...\" \"And don\\'t drive like my sister!\" The tagline was heard in the Pixar film Cars, in which Tom and Ray voiced anthropomorphized vehicles (Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze, respectively a 1963 Dodge Dart  and 1963 Dodge A100 van, as Lightning McQueen\\'s racing sponsors) with personalities similar to their own on-air personae. Tom notoriously once owned a \"convertible, green with large areas of rust!\" Dodge Dart, known jokingly on the program by the faux-elegant name \"Dartre\".\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nIn 1977, radio station WBUR-FM in Boston scheduled a panel of local car mechanics to discuss car repairs on one of its programs, but only Tom Magliozzi showed up. He did so well that he was asked to return as a guest, and he invited his younger brother Ray (who was actually more of a car repair expert) to join him. The brothers were soon asked to host their own radio show on WBUR, which they continued to do every week. In 1986, NPR decided to distribute their show nationally.\\n\\nIn 1989, the brothers started a newspaper column Click and Clack Talk Cars which, like the radio show, mixed serious advice with humor. King Features distributes the column. Ray Magliozzi continues to write the column, retitled Car Talk, after his brother\\'s death in 2014, knowing he would have wanted the advice and humor to continue.\\n\\nIn 1992, Car Talk won a Peabody Award, saying \"Each week, master mechanics Tom and Ray Magliozzi provide useful information about preserving and protecting our cars. But the real core of this program is what it tells us about human mechanics\\xa0... The insight and laughter provided by Messrs. Magliozzi, in conjunction with their producer Doug Berman, provide a weekly mental tune-up for a vast and ever-growing public radio audience.\"\\n\\nIn 2005, Tom and Ray Magliozzi founded the Car Talk Vehicle Donation Program, \"as a way to give back to the stations that were our friends and partners for decades — and whose programs we listen to every day.\" Since the Car Talk Vehicle Donation Program was founded, over 40,000 vehicles have been donated to support local NPR stations and programs, with over $40 million donated. Approximately 70% of the proceeds generated go directly toward funding local NPR affiliates and programs. \\n\\nIn May 2007, the program, which previously had been available digitally only as a paid subscription from Audible.com, became a free podcast distributed by NPR, after a two-month test period where only a \"call of the week\" was available via podcast.\\n\\nAs of 2012, it had 3.3 million listeners each week, on about 660 stations. On June 8, 2012, the brothers announced that they would no longer broadcast new episodes as of October.  Executive producer Doug Berman said the best material from 25 years of past shows would be used to put together \"repurposed\" shows for NPR to broadcast. Berman estimated the archives contain enough for eight years\\' worth of material before anything would have to be repeated. Ray Magliozzi, however, would occasionally record new taglines and sponsor announcements that were aired at the end of the show.\\n\\nThe show was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2014.\\n\\nRay Magliozzi hosted a special Car Talk memorial episode for his brother Tom after he died in November 2014. However, Ray continued to write their syndicated newspaper column, saying that his brother would want him to.\\n\\nThe Best of Car Talk episodes ended their weekly broadcast on NPR on September 30, 2017, although past episodes would continue availability online and via podcasts. 120 of the 400 stations intended to continue airing the show. NPR announced one option for the time slot would be their new news-talk program It\\'s Been a Minute.\\n\\nOn June 11, 2021, it was announced that radio distribution of Car Talk would officially end on October 1, 2021, and that NPR would begin distribution of a twice-weekly podcast that will be 35-40 minutes in length and include early versions of every show, in sequential order.\\n\\nHosts\\n\\nThe Magliozzis were long-time auto mechanics. Ray Magliozzi has a bachelor of science degree in humanities and science from MIT, while Tom had a bachelor of science degree in economics from MIT, an MBA  from Northeastern University, and a DBA from the Boston University School of Management. \\n\\nThe Magliozzis operated a do-it-yourself garage together in the 1970s which became more of a conventional repair shop in the 1980s. Ray continued to have a hand in the day-to-day operations of the shop for years, while his brother Tom semi-retired, often joking on Car Talk about his distaste for doing \"actual work\". The show\\'s offices were located near their shop at the corner of JFK Street and Brattle Street in Harvard Square, marked as \"Dewey, Cheetham & Howe\", the imaginary law firm to which they referred on-air. DC&H doubled as the business name of Tappet Brothers Associates, the corporation established to manage the business end of Car Talk. Initially a joke, the company was incorporated after the show expanded from a single station to national syndication.\\n\\nThe two were commencement speakers at MIT in 1999.\\n\\nExecutive producer Doug Berman said in 2012, \"The guys are culturally right up there with Mark Twain and the Marx Brothers. They will stand the test of time. People will still be enjoying them years from now. They\\'re that good.\"\\n\\nTom Magliozzi died on November 3, 2014, at age 77, due to complications from Alzheimer\\'s disease.\\n\\nAdaptations\\n\\nThe show was the inspiration for the short-lived The George Wendt Show, which briefly aired on CBS in the 1994-1995 season as a mid-season replacement.\\n\\nIn July 2007, PBS announced that it had green-lit an animated adaptation of Car Talk, to air on prime-time in 2008. The show, titled Click and Clack\\'s As the Wrench Turns is based on the adventures of the fictional \"Click and Clack\" brothers\\' garage at \"Car Talk Plaza\". The ten episodes aired in July and August 2008.\\n\\nCar Talk: The Musical!!! was written and directed by Wesley Savick, and composed by Michael Wartofsky. The adaptation was presented by Suffolk University, and opened on March 31, 2011, at the Modern Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts. The play was not officially endorsed by the Magliozzis, but they participated in the production, lending their voices to a central puppet character named \"The Wizard of Cahs\".\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nClick and Clack\\'s As the Wrench Turns official site (archived)\\nTranscript of the Magliozzis\\' commencement address at MIT, 1999\\n\\n1970s American radio programs\\n1977 radio programme debuts\\n1980s American radio programs\\n1990s American radio programs\\n2000s American radio programs\\n2010s American radio programs\\n2012 radio programme endings\\nAmerican talk radio programs\\nCambridge, Massachusetts\\nMass media in Boston\\nMotor vehicle maintenance\\nNPR programs\\nPeabody Award-winning radio programs'}\n",

      "{'id': '805725', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHDH%20%28TV%29', 'title': 'WHDH (TV)', 'text': 'WHDH, virtual channel 7 (UHF digital channel 35), is an independent television station licensed to Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Owned by Miami-based Sunbeam Television, it is part of a duopoly with Cambridge-licensed CW affiliate WLVI (channel 56). Both stations share studios at Bulfinch Place (near Government Center) in downtown Boston and transmitter facilities in Newton, Massachusetts.\\n\\nFrom 1982 to 1995, WHDH was Boston\\'s CBS affiliate, inheriting the affiliation from its predecessor on channel 7, WNAC-TV. On January 2, 1995, WHDH switched to NBC, after CBS moved to WBZ-TV (channel 4) by virtue of a group-wide affiliation deal with its owner, Westinghouse Broadcasting (CBS and Westinghouse merged that November, making WBZ-TV a CBS owned-and-operated station). On January 1, 2017, after losing NBC\\'s affiliation to a newly formed owned-and-operated station, WBTS-LD (channel 8, now Telemundo O&O WYCN-LD in Providence, Rhode Island), WHDH became a news-intensive independent station.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nWNAC-TV\\'s fight for survival and transition (1948–1982)\\n\\nThe original occupant of the channel 7 allocation in Boston was WNAC-TV, which commenced operations on June 21, 1948, as Boston\\'s first CBS affiliate. The station switched to ABC in 1961, but rejoined CBS in 1972.\\n\\nBy 1965, WNAC-TV\\'s owner, RKO General, faced numerous investigations into its business and financial practices. Though the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) renewed WNAC-TV\\'s license in 1969, RKO General lost the license in 1981 after its parent company, General Tire, admitted to a litany of corporate misconduct—which among other things, included the admission that General Tire had committed financial fraud over illegal political contributions and bribes—as part of a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, in the FCC hearings, RKO General had withheld evidence of General Tire\\'s misconduct, and had also failed to disclose evidence of accounting errors on its own part. In light of RKO\\'s dishonesty, the FCC stripped RKO of the Boston license and the licenses for KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV) in Los Angeles and WOR-TV in New York City (now WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey). The FCC had previously conditioned renewal of the latter two stations\\' licenses on WNAC-TV\\'s renewal. An appeals court partially reversed the ruling, finding that RKO\\'s dishonesty alone merited having the WNAC-TV license removed. However, it held that the FCC had overreached in tying the other two license renewals to WNAC-TV\\'s renewal, and ordered new hearings.\\n\\nThough RKO continued to appeal the decision, in late February 1982 the FCC granted the New England Television Corporation (NETV, a merger of two of the original rivals to the station\\'s license controlled by Boston grocery magnate David Mugar) a construction permit to build a new station on channel 7. Two months later in April, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear RKO\\'s appeal, leaving the firm with no further recourse but to accept the Commission\\'s decision and surrender WNAC-TV\\'s license. RKO then sold the station\\'s non-license physical assets, including its studio on Bulfinch Place and transmitter/tower site in suburban Newton, to NETV. RKO General formally surrendered the WNAC-TV license at midnight on May 21, 1982; the station signed off as WNAC-TV for the final time about an hour later.\\n\\nAs WNEV-TV (1982–1990)\\nNETV took over channel 7 nearly five hours later under a new license, signing on the new WNEV-TV at 5:55\\xa0a.m. ET that morning (however, the present WHDH does claim WNAC\\'s previous history as its own; a similar situation exists locally with the present-day WCVB and the original WHDH). Behind the imaging theme \"There\\'s a New Day Dawning\", WNEV-TV dropped WNAC-TV\\'s strip-layered \"7\" logo in favor of a new stylized \"SE7EN\" logo. At the time, the FCC would not allow two broadcast stations with differentiating owners in the same city to use the same call sign, so the WNEV call sign was used in its place of the original WNAC-TV call letters. However, the new station inherited WNAC-TV\\'s CBS affiliation and syndicated program contracts, and most of the former WNAC-TV staff—including news reporter and anchor Mike Taibbi, who signed the station on the air in a brief ceremony prior to WNEV-TV\\'s first program, CBS\\' Summer Semester.\\n\\nNETV\\'s mission from the start was to allocate programming hours to innovative, in-house productions, in much the same way that Boston Broadcasters did when it launched WCVB-TV on channel 5 ten years earlier. Notable productions that premiered early on were Look (1982–1984), which began as a two-hour (4:00\\xa0p.m. to 6:00\\xa0p.m.) late afternoon talk and lifestyle show that led into WNEV\\'s 6:00\\xa0p.m. newscast. Despite a powerful effort at an entertaining and informative program, and praise from critics, Look was a ratings failure; for its second year, the show was cut back to an hour and renamed New England Afternoon before being dropped. WNEV continued to produce talk programs, first with Morning/Live (1984–1987), a half-hour weekday morning talk show hosted by Susan Sikora, and later with the similarly structured Talk of the Town (1988), hosted by Matt Lauer. Nancy Merrill, former host of WBZ-TV\\'s People Are Talking, headlined two talk shows on WNEV, the weekend late night entry Merrill at Midnight (1986–87) and the weekday morning program Nancy Merrill (1987–88).\\n\\nNETV also made it an immediate purpose to further diversify the station\\'s workforce, both on-air and behind the scenes. Within WNEV\\'s first couple of years, there was an increase of news reporters and anchors of color joining the station (notably including anchor Lester Strong and reporter Amalia Barreda). The commitment to diversity extended itself to a series of new public affairs shows that each targeted a specific ethnic group: Urban Update (with an African-American focus and which still continues to air on WHDH), Revista Hispana, Asian Focus and Jewish Perspective. Other public affairs and newsmagazines launched by WNEV included a Sunday morning religious affairs program, Higher Ground, the weekend talk and advice show Boston Common, the Saturday night newsmagazine Our Times, and Studio 7, which focused on the arts.\\n\\nIn 1987, another of WNEV\\'s ambitious efforts premiered, the hour-long live children\\'s variety show Ready to Go. Featuring Broadway actress/singer Liz Callaway and Scott Reese, who not only hosted but also sang and acted, the program featured an equal mix of entertainment and educational content, along with musical acts and celebrity interviews. The series began as a 6:00\\xa0a.m. to 7:00\\xa0a.m. programming alternative against WBZ and WCVB\\'s morning newscasts, before moving to 7:00\\xa0a.m. in September 1989. On March 24, 1990, after only six months at its new time slot, the station cut the series back to once-a-week Saturday broadcasts only, before canceling the show outright in 1991.\\n\\nIn mid-August 1987, WNEV overhauled its on-air image. The station dropped its \"SE7EN\" identity in favor of a new logo, which consisted of the number \"7\" made up of seven white dots inside of a blue circle. The logo was introduced as a part of the new station-wide campaign, \"We\\'re All on the Same Team\", in which the seven dots represented the heads of team members. The dots also had dual usage, as lottery balls, in promotions for Lottery Live, the Massachusetts State Lottery drawings which were moving to WNEV late that summer. The campaign was primarily launched as a continued attempt to bolster the station\\'s third-place news ratings, and to promote its news-sharing partnership with other TV and radio stations, The New England News Exchange.\\n\\nWHDH radio (1990–1992)\\nThroughout the 1980s, WNEV-TV frequently partnered with WHDH radio (850 AM; frequency now occupied by WEEI) for public events such as Project Bread and the Walk For Hunger, as well as for other initiatives. NETV would eventually purchase WHDH on August 7, 1989. In January 1990, Mugar announced that on March 12 of that year, WNEV would change its call letters to WHDH-TV, in order to correspond with its sister radio operation. The WHDH-TV call sign was previously used by the original occupant of channel 5, under the ownership of the Boston Herald-Traveler, from 1957 to 1972. It was Mugar\\'s plan to create, once again, a second major television/radio duopoly, primarily in news, to compete with the long-standing combo of WBZ radio and WBZ-TV. Boston Mayor Ray Flynn declared March 12, 1990, as \"WHDH Day\" in Boston, celebrating the joining of the radio and television stations. On that day, personalities from WHDH-TV spoke as guests on WHDH radio.\\n\\nThe dual operation, which began with much fanfare and leverage, proved to be too costly for Mugar and company. NETV gradually slid into a deficit, prompting cutbacks on in-house programming as well as in the television station\\'s news department; the most notable effect being the elimination of WHDH-TV\\'s 5:00\\xa0p.m. newscast for two years beginning in 1991. With channel 7\\'s news ratings in third place, minimal help from CBS (which had been in a ratings slump since the end of the 1987–88 television season) and declining profits, Mugar was eventually prompted to sell the WHDH stations. The radio station was sold to Atlantic Ventures in 1992.\\n\\nSale to Sunbeam\\nBy 1991, the relationship between majority owner David Mugar and minority owner Robert Kraft had become strained. Kraft, who is the current owner of the New England Patriots, exercised an option that forced Mugar to purchase his shares for an estimated $25 million. This, along with the nearly $100 million debt he held from the 1986 buyout and falling advertising revenues left Mugar strapped for cash. On April 22, 1993, David Mugar entered into an agreement to sell WHDH to Miami-based Sunbeam Television, a company led by Worcester native Edmund Ansin. The purchase was completed in late July.\\n\\nShortly afterward, Ansin brought in news director Joel Cheatwood from his Miami flagship station WSVN. Cheatwood had become infamous in Miami for his changes to WSVN\\'s news operation, which focused on visually intensive, fast-paced newscasts with heavy emphasis on tabloid journalism, particularly covering crime (WSVN—which was an NBC affiliate from its 1956 sign-on until it joined Fox in 1989—adopted the format developed by Cheatwood in order to buoy viewership for its newscasts, which like WHDH, had languished in third place for several years). Cheatwood planned to perform similar changes at WHDH. Cheatwood ultimately adopted a considerably watered-down version of WSVN\\'s format (see below), but still retained many of WSVN\\'s features, including a faster-paced format, increased use of graphics and visuals, and more on-the-scene reporting. It even adopted WSVN\\'s version of the Circle 7 logo. While critics were concerned that WHDH would lose even more viewers if it were to adopt WSVN\\'s format entirely, WHDH quickly rebounded to become the number one newscast in Boston for a period.\\n\\nAs an NBC affiliate (1995–2017)\\nIn 1994, WBZ-TV\\'s owner, Westinghouse Broadcasting entered into a groupwide affiliation deal with CBS, which resulted in three Group W stations that were affiliated with networks other than CBS—NBC affiliates WBZ-TV, and KYW-TV in Philadelphia, and ABC affiliate WJZ-TV in Baltimore—switching to the network. Fox considered an affiliation deal with WHDH (even before the Group W announcement, channel 7 had reportedly been considering dropping CBS for Fox); however, on August 2, 1994, WHDH-TV announced that it had agreed to affiliate with NBC instead of Fox, in part citing NBC\\'s stronger news and sports programming. Fox ultimately chose to acquire its existing affiliate, WFXT (channel 25). WHDH became Boston\\'s NBC affiliate on January 2, 1995, replacing WBZ-TV (which had been with the network for 46 years). The final CBS program to air on channel 7 was the made-for-TV movie A Father for Charlie at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 1.\\n\\nDuring its time with NBC, channel 7 cleared the network\\'s entire programming schedule (an exception was the network\\'s early morning newscast at the time of the switch, NBC News at Sunrise, which ended on September 6, 1999; its successor, Early Today, was carried by WHDH for the remainder of its NBC affiliation). Between 1996 and 1997, WHDH produced a mid-morning weekday newsmagazine for the NBC network called Real Life. After the switch to NBC, WHDH became one of the few stations in the country to have had a primary affiliation with all of the Big Three networks. On September 14, 2006, Tribune Broadcasting sold CW affiliate WLVI-TV (channel 56) to Sunbeam Television for $117.3 million. The sale was approved by the FCC in late November of that year, creating Boston\\'s second television duopoly (the other one being WBZ-TV and WSBK-TV, channel 38). WLVI moved its operations from its Dorchester studios to WHDH\\'s facilities in downtown Boston.\\n\\nOn April 2, 2009, WHDH announced that it would not air The Jay Leno Show, when it debuted on NBC in September 2009, electing to replace it with a simulcast of the 10:00\\xa0p.m. newscast that WHDH began producing for WLVI in order to better compete with Fox affiliate WFXT. The network quickly dismissed any move of Leno to any time slot other than 10:00\\xa0p.m., stating that WHDH\\'s plan was a \"flagrant\" violation of the station\\'s contract with the network and that it would consider moving the NBC affiliation to another Boston area station, either by creating an owned-and-operated station through an \"existing broadcast license\" in the market owned by NBC or by seeking inquiries from other stations in the market to acquire the affiliation. WHDH began removing all references to the proposed 10:00\\xa0p.m. newscast from its website the next day, and on April 13, 2009, the station announced that it had decided to comply and air The Jay Leno Show instead.\\n\\nThe fears of possible ratings issues with the prime time talk show as the lead-in for its late newscast would become well-realized, as viewership for WHDH\\'s 11:00\\xa0p.m. news plunged to third place (a 20% drop from the previous year) during the November 2009 sweeps period. Other \\'first-to-third\\' drops among NBC affiliates\\' newscasts in the 11:00\\xa0p.m. slot forced the network on January 10, 2010 to pull Leno from 10:00\\xa0p.m. starting after the 2010 Winter Olympics and move him back to The Tonight Show in a shake-up of its late night schedule. Although the radio station had dropped the WHDH callsign in 1994, channel 7 retained the \"-TV\" suffix in its call letters until July 8, 2010.\\n\\nLoss of NBC affiliation\\nIt was reported on August 31, 2015 that NBC Owned Television Stations was considering the possibility of purchasing WHDH; NBCUniversal already had a strong presence in the market through its ownership of New England Cable News (NECN), CSN New England, and Telemundo station WNEU (channel 60), while WHDH\\'s NBC affiliation was set to expire at the end of 2016. Meredith Corporation and Nexstar Broadcasting Group were also reportedly interested in purchasing the station. NBCUniversal and Sunbeam denied these rumors. Sunbeam\\'s Executive Vice President and former WHDH general manager Chris Wayland, stated that the company \"fully [expects]\" that it would renew WHDH\\'s affiliation. The Boston Globe noted a history of hostility between NBC and Sunbeam, including its objection to NBC\\'s late-1980s purchase of WTVJ in Miami to displace its own WSVN (which later defected to Fox), and the aforementioned conflicts surrounding The Jay Leno Show. On October 1, 2015, The Boston Globe reported that NBC had considered moving the affiliation to NECN, a cable channel, rather than to an over-the-air channel, although the company declined to comment.\\n\\nOn December 15, 2015, New England One reported, citing internal sources, that NBCUniversal had declined to renew its affiliation with WHDH, and was beginning the process of building an English-language news operation at WNEU for its assumption of the affiliation. It also reported that WHDH meteorologist Pete Bouchard, who had left the station around the same time, had been poached by NBC for WNEU. Following the report, Paul Magnes, WHDH\\'s vice president and general manager, told the Boston Herald that the station still expected the NBC affiliation to be renewed.\\n\\nSunbeam owner Ed Ansin subsequently confirmed to The Boston Globe that NBC had informed him in September 2015, that channel 7\\'s affiliation would not be renewed, and offered to buy the station for $200 million; however, he said that he would not consider any offers worth less than $500 million, and that any sale of WHDH would also include WLVI. Ansin said that NBC was \"trying to steal our station,\" and confirmed that the network was threatening to shift its programming to WNEU, but that he still predicted that \"we\\'re going to be the NBC affiliate.\" Ansin believed that NBCUniversal\\'s main motivation for these moves were to create further synergies with WNEU and New England Cable News for the purposes of advertising sales. Initial reports suggested that if WHDH were to lose NBC programming, Sunbeam would move the CW affiliation currently held by WLVI to channel 7. However, Ansin subsequently stated that WHDH would be operated as a news-intensive independent station if the NBC affiliation was lost; additionally, WLVI\\'s own affiliation with The CW (a ten-year agreement made in 2006 with then-owner Tribune Broadcasting) was up for renewal in August 2016, and there was a possibility that CBS (who co-owns The CW with Time Warner) could transfer the CW affiliation to its MyNetworkTV affiliate WSBK-TV if WLVI was unable to renew.\\n\\nOn January 7, 2016, Valari Staab, president of NBC Owned Television Stations, confirmed that NBC would cease its affiliation with WHDH effective January 1, 2017, and that it would launch its owned-and-operated NBC outlet NBC Boston that day. Staab did not outright say whether NBC programming would be carried by WNEU, but that NBCUniversal was evaluating options for over-the-air carriage of the new outlet. Prior to the announcement, Ansin told The Boston Globe that he was considering challenging the planned move of NBC from WHDH, arguing that the proposed move would be in violation of conditions imposed by the FCC upon Comcast\\'s acquisition of NBC Universal, as the company agreed to maintain the over-the-air availability of NBC, and not use its cable holdings to influence affiliation deals. His position was supported by Senator Edward Markey; a representative of Markey stated that as a \"long-time supporter of universal service and free, over-the-air local broadcasting,\" he planned to \"closely scrutinize the impacts any deal could have on viewers in Massachusetts.\"\\n\\nOn March 10, 2016, Sunbeam Television sued Comcast in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, citing violations of antitrust law and the conditions which Comcast agreed to upon its purchase of NBC Universal. Sunbeam argued that because WNEU\\'s over-the-air signal radius covers four million fewer residents than WHDH, over-the-air viewers in these areas would have to purchase pay television service in order to maintain access to NBC programming—which would benefit Comcast\\'s cable business. Sunbeam also asserted that moving NBC to a company-owned station would \"[enable] Comcast to increase its monopoly power in the Boston television market, and the resulting decrease in competition will harm consumers, advertisers and other broadcasters.\" On May 16, 2016, the court granted a request of Comcast to dismiss the lawsuit, Judge Richard Stearn stated the loss of over-the-air coverage \"may be a matter of public concern, [but] it is not a concern that WHDH has standing to redress,\" and that \"absent any actionable harm attributable to Comcast, it is simply an indurate consequence of doing business in a competitive and unsentimental marketplace.\" WHDH intended to appeal the dismissal, and filed a notice of appeal on June 14, 2016; in a statement, Ansin said that the station believed \"the judge got it all wrong, so we are reviewing our options for an appeal.\"\\n\\nOn August 16, 2016, Ansin announced that he would no longer pursue the appeal against NBC, arguing that it was unlikely that the appeal would be resolved in his favor. Consequentially, the station officially announced a planned expansion of its news programming, including an expanded morning newscast and a prime time block of news spanning from 9:00\\xa0p.m. to 11:30\\xa0p.m., and that the 8:00\\xa0p.m. hour would be filled by syndicated programming. However, station lawyer Michael Gass told the Boston Business Journal that channel 7 was still pursuing the appeal, saying that \"[t]hey have to prepare to be a non-affiliate and have a plan for doing that even though we continue to believe that Comcast did not honor its obligations to us,\" while conceding that it was unlikely that a court would force NBC to remain on WHDH.\\n\\nOn November 1, 2016, NBCUniversal announced that it planned to simulcast NBC Boston on both WNEU\\'s second digital subchannel and on WBTS-LD (now WYCN-LD), the former WTMU-LP purchased by NBC the previous September. Initially, NBC also leased a subchannel of WMFP to help provide full-market coverage. This agreement ended in 2018 when NBC purchased Nashua, New Hampshire-licensed WYCN-CD (now WBTS-CD), to channel share with full-power PBS member station WGBX-TV, which transmits from Needham. WHDH\\'s affiliation formally ended at 3:00\\xa0a.m. ET on January 1, 2017. The final NBC program aired on channel 7 was New Year\\'s Eve with Carson Daly, which began on December 31, 2016 at 11:30 p.m. Shortly before NBC\\'s defection from WHDH, Graham Media Group\\'s KPRC-TV in Houston became the largest NBC station by market size that is not owned by the network, a status it obtained when Houston leapfrogged Boston in the DMA rankings a few months prior to NBC\\'s defection from WHDH. As of the 2020–2021 season, Atlanta has overtaken Houston, with Tegna\\'s WXIA-TV replacing KPRC-TV as the largest NBC station not owned by the network.\\n\\nProgramming\\n\\nPreempted programming\\nAs a CBS affiliate, the station preempted programming in moderation, in favor of more locally produced shows. From 1989 to 1990, the station delayed the first hour of CBS This Morning in favor of the children\\'s show Ready To Go. In February 1994, CBS This Morning was dropped and picked up by WABU (channel 68, now WBPX-TV). WHDH then began airing an expanded local morning newscast.\\n\\nSyndicated programming\\nThe station\\'s considerable local news output as of 2019 limits the number of programs WHDH carries in syndication; most of them air in non-prime slots or overnights. Programs include Dateline, The Doctors, Funny You Should Ask, Family Feud, Extra, Inside Edition, and many others.\\n\\nSpecial events\\nOn July 4, 2018, WHDH began to simulcast the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular yearly with Bloomberg Television, returning the event to local television after a one-year absence. It also broadcast A Boston Pops Salute to Our Heroes, which was produced in lieu of the 2020 edition of the event due to its cancellation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nLottery\\nWNEV/WHDH had exclusive rights to Lottery Live, broadcasting the Massachusetts State Lottery games six nights a week from August 31, 1987, to March 6, 1994. Motivated to cultivate an identity to the station that would indirectly help its last-place news ratings, WNEV acquired the lottery from WBZ-TV, which had announced late in 1986 that it would no longer show the games. The arrival of the lottery games was promoted heavily, and went hand-in-hand with the station\\'s on-air image change that fall; the new dotted-7 logo that was adopted during that time had a dual meaning, in that the dots were to represent lottery balls.\\n\\nA contest was held by WNEV in August 1987, just under a month before the games moved to the station, to scout for their own lottery host (Tom Bergeron, who hosted Lottery Live on WBZ-TV, did not continue in the role because he remained at that station in other capacities). The auditions were held in front of an audience of 200 at Boston\\'s Westin Hotel at Copley Place, in which the finalists were narrowed down to 16. The winner was Lynn-Andrea Waugh, familiarly known as \"Andi\", a 29-year-old red-haired model who had no prior on-air experience. Despite being well received by viewers due to her effervescent personality and striking good looks, Ms. Waugh never completely overcame her noticeable nervousness after taking to the air. Waugh abandoned her hosting spot upon the expiration of her contract in August 1988. She was replaced with Dawn Hayes, who had been the runner-up in the lottery host competition. Hayes, who was equally as appealing but with a polished, confident on-air presence, began her long run as host during this era.\\n\\nDuring Lottery Lives entire run on channel 7, the daily Numbers Game drawing aired at 7:52\\xa0p.m. (following the conclusion of the \"Double Jeopardy!\" round of Jeopardy!), while the specialty game of the evening (e.g., Mass Ca$h) originally aired during the CBS prime time lineup at 9:50\\xa0p.m. (retaining the airtime the specialty games had on WBZ). From 1991 until the end of channel 7\\'s lottery contract in 1994, the specialty games were moved down to a 7:58\\xa0p.m. airtime, following the closing credits of Jeopardy!. Weekend lottery hosts during the channel 7 era included Linda Ward, Linda Frantangela (both prior to 1993) and Jill Stark (1993–94), who all substituted on weekdays as well when Hayes was absent. WNEV/WHDH also aired prime time game show specials produced by the Massachusetts State Lottery, usually a few times a year, that were broadcast either from the station\\'s studios at 7 Bulfinch Place or at other public venues across Boston.\\n\\nThe lottery commission saw tremendous growth during this period, increasing its sales to record highs, promoting further advertising and expanding its game roster (Mass Ca$h, which launched in 1991, was added to the already successful lineup of The Numbers Game and specialty games Megabuck$ and Mass Millions). Channel 7\\'s nightly broadcasts of Lottery Live and the periodic sweepstakes specials were integral in fielding this success for the lottery; this, combined with Lottery Live pulling in high ratings as a part of the Wheel of Fortune/Jeopardy! hour, which ranked first place in 7:00\\xa0p.m. to 8:00\\xa0p.m. prime access, caused the station to renew the lottery contract for another three years in 1990. After the sale to Sunbeam in 1993, WHDH\\'s contract with the lottery was not renewed, despite continued success on the station. Lottery rights were subsequently picked up by WCVB, which began airing the nightly drawings on March 7, 1994. The Lottery Live format moved to its third consecutive station, with Dawn Hayes being retained as host by WCVB.\\n\\nSports programming\\nWHDH became the primary station for the New England Patriots in 1995, as the Patriots played in the American Football Conference of the NFL, which had a deal with NBC for the network to air AFC games (thus Boston was not as important as a market for Fox in regards to getting an VHF affiliate). When the AFC package moved to CBS in 1998, this role was reclaimed by WBZ-TV. From 2006 to 2016, the station aired Patriots games when they were featured on NBC Sunday Night Football (the station aired the Patriots\\' Super Bowl XLIX victory in 2015). Also, WHDH aired selected Red Sox games from 1990 to 1993 as a CBS station via that network\\'s MLB over-the-air broadcast contract, and again through NBC\\'s limited rights to MLB\\'s postseason from 1995 to 2000. WNEV/WHDH has also aired Boston Celtics games, first via CBS\\' broadcast contract with the NBA from 1982 to 1990 (continuing what WNAC-TV had aired since 1973; their NBA Finals victories in 1984 and 1986 were aired on WNEV), and again through NBC from 1995 to 2002. From 2006 to 2016, the station also aired Boston Bruins games via the NHL on NBC, including their victory in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals.\\n\\nBetween 1992 and 2016, WHDH aired a total of twelve Olympic Games; the first two events in 1992 and 1994 were aired while the station was affiliated with CBS, with the remaining ten games airing while the station was affiliated with NBC (WBZ-TV aired its last Olympic broadcast in 1998).\\n\\nNews operation\\n\\nWHDH presently broadcasts 73½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week, with 12 hours each weekday, 6½ hours on Saturdays, and seven hours on Sundays. In regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the fourth-highest newscast output of any broadcast television station in the entire United States, behind Los Angeles CW affiliate KTLA (channel 5), which broadcasts 89 hours, 20 minutes of local newscasts per week; Indianapolis CW affiliate WISH-TV (channel 8), which broadcasts 76 hours of locally produced newscasts and programs each week; and Phoenix independent KTVK (channel 3), which broadcasts 74 hours of local newscasts per week. In addition, the station produces Urban Update, a discussion program focusing on issues affecting the African American community, and Honda Sports Xtra, a weekly half-hour sports highlight program. The station operates a Bell LongRanger 206L news helicopter entitled \"Sky 7\". The station\\'s weather radar is presented on-air as \"Storm Scan Doppler\" with a signal coming from the radar at the National Weather Service local forecast office in Taunton.\\n\\nMedia partnerships\\nThe station, in partnership with MetroNetworks, launched the TrafficTracker truck during the 2004 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Boston. With traffic reporter Marshall Hook behind the wheel of one of the station\\'s live vehicles, WHDH became the only station in the market to produce live traffic reports from the road. The station continues to use the TrafficTracker during snowstorms, including the December 13, 2007 storm that resulted in paralyzing commutes that, in some cases, exceeded seven hours.\\n\\nWHDH shares its resources with WJAR, the NBC affiliate in Providence, Rhode Island, for news coverage of southeastern Massachusetts. WWLP, the NBC affiliate in Springfield, shares its resources with WHDH for news coverage of western areas of the state.\\n\\nNews department history\\n\\n1982–1993\\nWNAC-TV had spent the better part of its history as the lowest-rated major-network affiliate in Boston, and one of the weakest large-market CBS affiliates in the country. When New England Television began operating the station, it embarked on a massive attempt to bring channel 7 out of the ratings basement. David Mugar and company soon announced the infamous \"dream team\" of newscasters, headed by Tom Ellis and Robin Young. Ellis had previously maintained WBZ-TV\\'s dominance in the news market, and then helped WCVB reach #1 in the ratings during his tenure there from 1978 to 1982. Young, on the other hand, had no hard news experience but was well-known to Boston viewers as former co-host of Evening Magazine. The new partnership, as well as the completely restructured news department as a whole, received heavy promotion in the months leading to the official launch of the finalized WNEV news product (accompanied by a launch image campaign, \"There\\'s A New Day Dawning\"). The newsroom facility, built feverishly over the summer of 1982, was cited by The Boston Globe as being the most technologically advanced out of all three network stations in the market. On the night of Ellis and Young\\'s debut, September 13, 1982, WNEV beat WCVB and WBZ in the evening news ratings. The curiosity of Boston viewers only lasted a week in large numbers; the following week, channel 7 crumbled back to a distant third.\\n\\nWNEV\\'s news department underwent more shakeups, both in talent and identity, due to ongoing sagging ratings. WNEV\\'s inaugural station manager, Winthrop \"Win\" Baker, and his news director Bill Applegate were both fired in May 1983. Replacing Baker was former WBZ-TV programming head Sy Yanoff, whom Mugar had the utmost confidence in given his track record at channel 4 (both Ellis and Young had worked for Yanoff at separate times, years earlier, at channel 4; this was a major factor in him taking the job). Yanoff quickly brought former WBZ-TV news director Jeff Rosser to the same post at channel 7, with a five-year contract. Over the summer, the two fired quite a few of the 1982 \"dream team\" hires, in an effort to strengthen and better utilize the talents that worked. The largest issue they faced was the public perception that Young and Ellis were a mismatched anchor team. Young, whose informal presence began to contrast severely with the seriousness of Ellis, was offered new avenues at WNEV by Yanoff so that the station could boast a more balanced, serious lead anchor team. Although she had stated in the spring of 1983 that she was at the anchor desk for the long haul, Young made a move with Yanoff and Mugar that July which granted her airtime on WNEV for prime time specials produced through her private production company, Young Visions. Young decided that leaving the news department would allow her more time to focus on these specials, as well as the availability to be an all-purpose station personality.\\n\\nDuring that summer, as Young geared up to vacate her anchor position, Yanoff and Rosser named four possible successors, including KNXT reporter Terry Murphy (later of Hard Copy fame) and WNEV\\'s own reporter Diane Willis, who had been among the station\\'s new hires the previous year. Willis was selected for the position in early September, and began anchoring with Tom Ellis that same month. Young, meanwhile, went on to host her prime time specials and events until 1987.\\n\\nIn the spring of 1984, NETV moved its on-air news look away from the changes made only two years prior, taking away the anchoring desk from the newsroom and utilizing a backdrop allowing chroma keys and CGI graphics to be placed. WNEV also began a network of regional news bureaus known as the New England News Exchange, in which WNEV consulted with other stations (such as WCSH-TV in Portland, WLBZ-TV in Bangor, WFSB in Hartford, WLNE-TV in Providence and WMUR-TV in Manchester) and print media throughout the region to create a high-powered electronic news gathering organization. Despite a continued massive influx of capital and marketing (including a highly financed promotional campaign employing the refrain \"Feel Good About That\"), and more positive reviews of the station\\'s newscasts following the appointment of Willis as lead anchor, WNEV still failed to take the competition by storm.\\n\\nIn the spring of 1986, Yanoff and Rosser announced that they would try a second lead anchor team for the weeknight 11:00\\xa0p.m. newscasts in the fall. They planned to keep Ellis and Willis on at 6:00\\xa0p.m., while giving the 11:00\\xa0p.m. slot to weekend anchor/reporter Kate Sullivan and Dave Wright, an incoming newsman hired away from ATV in the Canadian Maritimes. However, when Rosser had a meeting with Willis for what was supposed to be her contract renewal, he was told by her that instead, she would be leaving to become a professor of journalism at Northeastern University. Willis and Rosser publicly announced her resignation in July, and Willis assured the staff that her decision to leave WNEV was isolated from her soon-to-be decreased air time. Ellis, on the other hand, was unhappy about his reduction, feeling that he was no longer being considered the station\\'s principal anchor. Yanoff and Rosser attempted to come to agreeable terms with Ellis, with two proposed plans—to either pair him with Kate Sullivan or Dave Wright, or to find him another replacement female anchor. It was purported that WNEV was even in discussions with by-then-former NBC anchor Linda Ellerbee for her to become Ellis\\' co-anchor. The anchor replacement and Wright-Ellis pairing ideas were ultimately nixed (by the 1980s, the idea of two men anchoring together was passe), with Sullivan and Wright taking over both the 6:00\\xa0p.m. and 11:00\\xa0p.m. newscasts in September. Ellis was demoted to reporter, a move that ultimately led to his exit from the station altogether in early December 1986.\\n\\nIn August 1987, numerous changes occurred when R.D. Sahl, who had been WNEV\\'s noon anchor on weekdays, joined Kate Sullivan as her new partner on weeknights (Sahl had filled in for Wright on numerous occasions during 1986 and 1987, and heavily in the summer of 1987 when Wright was recovering from a heart attack). At the same time, WNEV became the first Boston station to launch a 5:00\\xa0p.m. newscast, which was anchored by Dave Wright and Diana Williams. The Live at Five hour of the news was a cross between the informality of WBZ\\'s competing Live on 4 and WNEV\\'s regular newscasts, without the lifestyle and specialty features seen on Live on 4. However, there was a unique twist. Wright, who had created the Live at Five format at ATV (where he had hosted it from 1982 to 1986), brought the concept to WNEV, which had him and Williams walking around a special newsroom set sans an anchor desk as they presented stories. Featured reporters were seated at assignment desks on the set, as they contributed to the fray and chatted with Wright and Williams. The format soared in the ratings, a true accomplishment long labored by NETV. Ultimately, the news program\\'s producers started feuding, and Wright, who felt caught in the middle, resigned from WNEV in May 1988. Just prior to Wright\\'s departure, Jeff Rosser had left the station at the close of his contract, and arriving in his place was former WCVB news director Jim Thistle. By September 1988, the Live at Five format was dropped (as it remained the intellectual property of ATV), and the 5:00\\xa0p.m. to 6:00\\xa0p.m. block was restructured as a more conventional newscast, anchored by Williams and Lester Strong. After Williams departed for WABC-TV in 1990 (where she remains to this day), Strong anchored with new arrival Edye Tarbox in the 5:00\\xa0p.m. hour.\\n\\nBesides the locally prominent journalists who attempted to leverage WNEV\\'s news, a few future national talents had brief stints at the station in the 1980s. Bill O\\'Reilly, long before his national exposure on Inside Edition and Fox News Channel\\'s The O\\'Reilly Factor, co-anchored NEWSE7EN Weekend in 1982–83. Soon after, O\\'Reilly also became the host of the station\\'s weekday afternoon talk/lifestyle program, New England Afternoon (which replaced the ill-fated two-hour magazine show Look, canceled after its first season). His successor on the weekend newscast was Paula Zahn, since a newswoman of many television networks, who co-anchored with Lester Strong from 1983 to 1985. Rehema Ellis, who joined the station in 1985 as a general assignment reporter, eventually left to become an NBC News national correspondent in 1994. From May to November 1988, future Today host Matt Lauer hosted WNEV\\'s mid-morning talk show Talk of the Town. Two more WNEV/WHDH alumni would then hit the big time: reporter Miles O\\'Brien, a 1987 arrival to the station, left to join CNN in 1989. Edye Tarbox, now E.D. Hill, who was an anchor/reporter at WHDH from 1990 to 1992, later worked at Fox News Channel from 1999 to 2008.\\n\\nTom Ellis, who had been dethroned of the male lead anchor position at the station in 1986, came full circle when Inside Edition Extra, a companion series to the syndicated program Inside Edition, appeared on WHDH\\'s fall 1992 daytime schedule. Ellis had been named the host of IE Extra, which was a co-production of WHDH-TV and King World Productions; Ellis, thus, was employed by Boston\\'s channel 7 yet again, albeit for the national show. IE Extra, which was broadcast from the same New York City studio as Inside Edition, and aired in most markets after its parent series as part of an hour-long IE block (WHDH aired the shows back-to-back at 4:00\\xa0p.m.). Ellis also appeared following his former WNEV colleague, Bill O\\'Reilly, who had been anchoring Inside Edition since 1989. The scheduling only lasted a year, as Inside Edition Extra was canceled at the end of the 1992–93 season. This program has no relation to the current Extra, a Warner Bros.-produced entertainment magazine that premiered in the fall of 1994, and has aired on WHDH since 1999.\\n\\n1993–present\\nThere were abrupt changes when Sunbeam bought the station in 1993. New station owner Ed Ansin brought Joel Cheatwood, the creator of WSVN\\'s fast-paced news format, to Boston. Cheatwood introduced a considerably watered-down version of the WSVN format. However, it was still shocking by Boston standards. Prior to the debut of the new format and 7 News identity that November, Ansin and Cheatwood began changing anchor lineups: in mid October 1993, Margie Reedy was moved from the main evening newscasts to the Noon and 5:30\\xa0p.m. newscasts. Rehema Ellis was promoted to female lead anchor (at 6:00\\xa0p.m. and 11:00\\xa0p.m.) with R.D. Sahl. However, many of the crew\\'s doubts about the new, impending tabloid style were realized once the format switch was off and running. \\n\\nMore changes were in store concerning the look of the newscasts. Compared to the previous look of WHDH, which used soft, varied colors, both the default \"dotted 7\" logo and a more colorful version, a light theme (Advantage by Frank Gari, originally commissioned for WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut), and announcer Chris Clausen; WHDH\\'s new look was far different, incorporating dark blue, red, black, and silver. The \"dotted 7\" logo was succeeded by WSVN\\'s version of the \"circle 7\" logo. The graphics initially used a \"diagonal stripe\" theme, soon after these graphics were replaced with a new set which incorporated glass panels. The theme (\"7 News\", composed by Chris Crane, who has made various news themes that have been used by WSVN since 1991) was also quite different, made up of dissonant, droning synth chords. The music evolved in later years, incorporating the NBC chimes, as well as a more orchestral sound. The set was also steadily integrated into the newsroom, much like WSVN\\'s had been (taking a cue from CNN); the resulting set/newsroom hybrid was, like at WSVN, dubbed the Newsplex. It continues, and has been gradually updated over the years to reflect the graphical and technological updates done by the station. Chris Clausen was replaced by Scott Chapin, who was the announcer for WSVN since 1988; he continued to announce for both stations until January 2, 2011, when he was replaced by Paul Turner. Chapin returned to WHDH on December 29, 2014, three years after he was replaced. A similar format was adopted by KJRH-TV in Tulsa, Oklahoma between 1994 and 1997.\\n\\nMost of the station\\'s prominent newscasters wanted nothing to do with Cheatwood (who had a reputation as a pioneer in tabloid television). Ellis was one of the first to leave WHDH in response to Ansin\\'s changes. Only two months into her promotion to lead anchor, Ellis declared herself a free agent, quickly accepting an offer at NBC News as a national correspondent. She signed off from WHDH shortly after Christmas and began at NBC on January 1, 1994. R.D. Sahl was then sole anchor of the 6:00\\xa0p.m. and 11:00\\xa0p.m. newscasts, with fill-in anchors from other station positions joining him periodically. In January 1994, the station reinstated a weekday morning newscast, which NETV had cut a few years earlier due to the financial constraints. Sunbeam hired two new anchors, Kim Khazei and Gerry Grant, to helm the broadcast, titled 7 News Morning Edition. Originally airing from 5:00\\xa0a.m. to 7:00\\xa0a.m., the newscast expanded by an additional two hours to 9:00\\xa0a.m. when WHDH dropped the low-rated CBS This Morning in late February. At the same time, Sunbeam restored the 5:00\\xa0p.m. newscast cut by NETV.\\n\\nDuring this time, Sahl became quite vocal of his displeasure with the new tabloid format, and it was clear that he was looking for a way out of his contract as well. Cheatwood soon hired Kim Carrigan, a transplant from Des Moines, Iowa, who first appeared as female lead anchor alongside Sahl in April 1994. Sunbeam was confident that Carrigan, the 31-year-old newcomer, and the 46-year-old Sahl, by now a trusted Boston news veteran, would be the lasting lead anchor team for them, but in late July 1994, Sahl met with his legal counsel and came to an agreement over the termination of his WHDH contract. Sahl made his final appearance on 7 News in early August. Carrigan, who was quickly gaining a following, then continued on alone for several weeks at a time for the next four months. This made her the first female newscaster in Boston to anchor alone in the key 5:00\\xa0p.m., 6:00\\xa0p.m., and 11:00\\xa0p.m. time periods. At times during the fall of 1994, Carrigan would be joined by a rotation of male co-anchors, including Lester Strong, Gerry Grant, and Jonathan Hall; however, promotions for these newscasts during this time featured Carrigan as sole anchor. Margie Reedy, meanwhile, remained on the noon and 5:00 newscasts until her departure that December. Both Sahl and Reedy would join NECN soon afterward, where (save for Sahl\\'s short-lived stint at KCAL-TV in Los Angeles) they would remain for several years afterward.\\n\\nWhen WHDH switched to NBC in January 1995, the morning newscast was scaled back to the traditional 5:00\\xa0a.m. to 7:00\\xa0a.m. timeslot in order to accommodate Today; a few months later, it was renamed from 7 News Morning Edition to the current Today in New England. Later in January, as a result of a package deal WHDH had signed the previous fall, the station saw the arrival of husband-and-wife anchors John Marler and Cathy Marshall. Marler, a longtime anchor at WAGA-TV in Atlanta, joined Kim Carrigan at 5:00\\xa0p.m., 6:00\\xa0p.m., and 11:00\\xa0p.m. Marshall, who had been a CNN anchor, was originally unclear as to what her role with 7 News would be, but ultimately became Margie Reedy\\'s replacement at Noon and the 5:00\\xa0p.m. hour, beside Lester Strong. These two anchoring teams remained in place for the next three years. Gerry Grant departed from the morning newscast in February 1995 to join the reporting staff of Entertainment Tonight; he was replaced that April by Alison Gilman. Former WBZ-TV anchor Randy Price, who had joined WHDH in 1996, first as a freelance reporter and then as a weekday morning anchor (taking over from the departing Gilman in February 1997), replaced Marler at 5:00\\xa0p.m., 6:00\\xa0p.m., and 11:00\\xa0p.m. in August 1998.\\n\\nChannel 7, which for several years had already begun a tradition of scheduling news in (previously) untraditional time periods, broke further ground again with the addition of a half-hour 4:00\\xa0p.m. newscast in June 1996, which gave Strong and Marshall additional anchor duties. The newscast was launched when WHDH sought an alternative to its previous efforts to program the 4:00\\xa0p.m. time slot (including Inside Edition through the end of the 1993–94 season, A Current Affair from September 1994 to January 1996 and finally, the WSVN-produced Deco Drive, the latter two programs of which had underperformed for the station). The 4:00\\xa0p.m. newscast was originally separated from the existing early evening news block by Hard Copy, and later by Extra after Hard Copy ended its run in September 1999; after Extra moved to 7:30\\xa0p.m. in September 2001, WHDH launched a 4:30\\xa0p.m. newscast (the second in Boston, after a newscast on WFXT that launched three months earlier).\\n\\nThe fast-paced Sunbeam news format rejuvenated WHDH\\'s ratings, especially after switching to NBC. For most of the last decade, WHDH has waged a spirited battle for first place, behind long-dominant WCVB. In 2002, WHDH was noted as having the best newscast in the U.S. in a study published by the Columbia Journalism Review. In previous studies, the station was deemed as having one of the worst newscasts. On December 19, 2006, WHDH took over production of WLVI\\'s nightly 10:00\\xa0p.m. newscast (after Sunbeam\\'s purchase of the station resulted in the shutdown of channel 56\\'s in-house news department). On February 29, 2008, it was reported that the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike caused a significant loss in viewers for the station\\'s late newscast. WHDH-TV finished at 11:00\\xa0p.m., with an average of 166,100 total viewers, down from 199,900 viewers in 2007.\\n\\nFrom 1997 to 2003, WHDH\\'s staff included field reporter Jeffery Derderian, who was a co-owner of The Station nightclub with his brother Michael. Jeffrey resigned from WHDH in February 2003 to join WPRI-TV in Providence, Rhode Island. Three days later, a fire engulfed the Station nightclub, killing 100 people.\\n\\nOn July 29, 2008, WHDH became the second station in Boston (after WCVB-TV) to begin broadcasting its newscasts in high definition. On that day, revised graphics, music, and an updated newsplex also made their debut. During the transition, the station\\'s newscasts were conducted in front of a green screen showing the former newsplex while renovations to that set were being done. On August 22, 2011, WHDH launched an hour-long 9:00 a.m. newscast, which replaced Live with Regis and Kelly after it moved from WHDH to WCVB-TV. Originally slated to premiere on September 12, 2011, the launch date of the newscast was moved up three weeks to August 22, 2011. Live, which had aired on the station since it premiered nationally in 1988, moved to WCVB on the latter date, airing directly opposite the WHDH newscast.\\n\\nFollowing the station\\'s decision on August 16, 2016, to drop its objection to the loss of the NBC affiliation at the end of the year, WHDH announced that it would add additional local newscasts; following this expansion, channel 7 would broadcast over 87 hours of newscasts a week.

On February 2, 2009, WHDH-DT2 began carrying programming from This TV. Via digital cable, channel 7.2 is offered on Comcast channel 936 and Verizon FiOS channel 460.\\n\\nAnalog-to-digital conversion\\nWHDH shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7 on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station\\'s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 42 to VHF channel 7 for post-transition operations. Because of a large number of complaints regarding the inability of viewers to receive over-the-air programming on channel 7, WHDH requested and received temporary authority from the FCC on June 16, 2009 to simulcast its programming on UHF channel 42, in addition to VHF channel 7. Although stations in other major markets have similar problems, WHDH is the only station in the Boston area market which changed its digital channel due to the June 2009 transition, requiring a channel map rescan to receive the station. WHDH was also one of three area stations, along with WMUR-TV (channel 9) and WWDP (channel 46), to broadcast in VHF post-transition, requiring either a traditional indoor antenna within Boston proper, or in outer areas at minimum an outdoor antenna.\\n\\nOn September 15, 2009, the FCC issued a Report & Order, approving WHDH\\'s move from channel 7 to channel 42. After the station filed its minor change application for a construction permit, stating the channel move, on November 9, 2009, WHDH terminated operations on VHF channel 7 and now permanently operates solely on channel 42 (mapping to virtual channel 7 via PSIP). The equipment for the channel 7 digital transmitter was shipped to Miami for use by sister station WSVN, which continues to broadcast on VHF 7 with few complaints due to South Florida\\'s less-varied terrain. On June 1, 2010, WHDH filed an application to operate at the power level of 1 million watts. The application was approved on December 14, 2010.\\n\\nCoverage in Canada\\nWHDH was one of six Boston area television stations that is carried on Canadian satellite provider Bell Satellite TV and was authorized as an American over-the-air station eligible for national distribution. It was also available via the Anik F1 satellite to several Canadian cable providers, particularly in Atlantic Canada. Other cable systems also carried WHDH, such as Citizens Cable Television in the Thousand Islands region of New York State and Bermuda CableVision.\\n\\nWYCN-LD (as WBTS-LD) was authorized to provide NBC service over Canadian pay-TV on December 20, 2016. Most providers carrying WHDH, including Bell Canada-owned providers and Eastlink, replaced it with WBTS effective January 1, 2017, coinciding with end of WHDH\\'s NBC affiliation; despite this, , WHDH remains on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)\\'s list of eligible non-Canadian services and stations that can be distributed in the country.\\n\\nSee also\\n Channel 7 virtual TV stations in the United States\\n Channel 35 digital TV stations in the United States\\n List of television stations in Massachusetts\\n List of United States stations available in Canada\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nGallant, Joseph.

      "Top documents for question: What year was Napster developed by Shawn Fanning?\n",
      "Similarity: 0.9027\n",
      "{'id': '38056', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn%20Fanning', 'title': 'Shawn Fanning', 'text': 'Shawn Fanning (born November 22, 1980) is an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, and angel investor. He developed Napster, one of the first popular peer-to-peer (\"P2P\") file sharing platforms, in 1999. The popularity of Napster was widespread and Fanning was featured on the cover of Time magazine.\\n\\nThe site in its initial free P2P incarnation was shut down in 2001 after the company\\'s unsuccessful appeal of court orders arising from its encouraging the illegal sharing of copyrighted material. A paid subscription version of the site followed, and was purchased by Rhapsody on December 1, 2011.  Following his involvement with Napster, he joined, and invested in, a number of early-stage technology startup companies.\\n\\nComputer career\\n\\nNapster\\nOn June 1, 1999, Fanning released a preliminary beta program of Napster and soon, hundreds of college students at Northeastern were trading music. Sean Parker was the co-founder. They got the name from Shawn\\'s Harwich High School nickname \"Nappy\", in reference to his Afro.  Shawn played on the Harwich Tennis Team.\\n\\nSnocap\\nIn 2002, Fanning was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35. In 2003, he opened a new company, Snocap, along with Jordan Mendelson (Napster\\'s Chief Architect), and Ron Conway. The company aspired to be a legitimate marketplace for digital media. However, their partners and the public did not respond well. Customer support was poor, and technical issues were numerous. One of their primary partners, CD Baby, wrote a scathing account of their relationship. In late 2007, Snocap laid off 60% of its workforce. ValleyWag wrote an article that Fanning had long left Snocap and began to work on another venture, Rupture. The ValleyWag article stated that the failure was largely due to Snocap\\'s CEO Rusty Rueff and that of former VP Engineering Dave Rowley, who \"made a mess of engineering before he was fired\". Snocap was looking to sell itself and fast.  In 2008, they found a buyer; imeem acquired Snocap in a fire sale.\\n\\nRupture\\nThe Rupture project was announced in 2007 with seed funding.\\n\\nIn December 2006, Fanning, along with Co-founder Jon Baudanza, developed Rupture, a social networking tool designed to handle the task of publishing gamers\\' individual profiles to a communal space and facilitating communication between World of Warcraft players. Rupture was later acquired by Electronic Arts for $30 million. Fanning\\'s career at Electronic Arts was short-lived as a round of layoffs in November 2009 included him and his team at Rupture.\\n\\nPath\\nA few months after Fanning was laid off from Electronic Arts, he started a new company called Path.com. In January 2010, Dave Morin announced he was leaving Facebook, where he was a Senior Platform Manager, to join Fanning and become CEO at Path.\\n\\nAirtime\\nIn 2011 Fanning reunited with Napster cofounder Sean Parker to found Airtime.com. Some of the investors are Ron Conway, Michael Arrington, and Ashton Kutcher. Fanning serves as CEO and Parker as executive chairman.\\n\\nAirtime launched in June 2012 at a disastrous public event where Parker and Fanning paid huge amounts of money to have celebrities present but the product repeatedly crashed and ultimately failed to work. Greg Sandoval of CNET commented, \"To launch his new start-up, Sean Parker should have spent less of his billions on celebrity guests and more of it on fixing his technology.\"\\n\\nHelium Systems \\nIn 2013 Fanning founded Helium Systems together with Amir Haleem, and Sean Carey. In December 2014, the company announced that it had raised $16 million in funding led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from FirstMark Capital, Digital Garage, Marc Benioff, SV Angel, and Slow Ventures among others.\\n\\nIn popular culture \\nIn 2000, Fanning appeared as a presenter at the MTV Video Music Awards. He appeared wearing a Metallica T-shirt as the Metallica v. Napster, Inc. lawsuit had been filed a few months prior. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" played in the background. When asked where he got the shirt, Fanning stated, \"a friend of mine shared it with me.\" Lars Ulrich was sitting in the audience, and his reaction was shown as feigned boredom.\\n\\nIn October 2000, Fanning was featured on the cover of Time magazine.\\n\\nFanning had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2003 film The Italian Job. In the film, Seth Green\\'s character Lyle accused Fanning of stealing Napster from him while he was taking a nap in their Northeastern University dorm room. Although other characters see this as mere bragging, a scene shows Fanning in fact creeping over Lyle\\'s sleeping body and stealing a  floppy disk.\\n\\nIn early 2008, Fanning appeared in a Volkswagen commercial directed by Roman Coppola, in which he poked fun at his file-sharing past.\\n\\nFanning and Napster were the subject of Alex Winter\\'s documentary Downloaded in 2013.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\n Rupture\\n Path\\n Airtime\\n\\n1980 births\\nBusinesspeople from Massachusetts\\nAmerican computer programmers\\nFile sharing\\nLiving people\\nNortheastern University alumni\\nPeople from Brockton, Massachusetts\\nPeople from Harwich, Massachusetts\\nPeople from Hull, Massachusetts\\n21st-century American businesspeople'}\n",
